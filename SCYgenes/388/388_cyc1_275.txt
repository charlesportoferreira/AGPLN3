A mutation allowing an mRNA secondary structure diminishes translation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-cytochrome c.

The CYC1-239-O mutation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces a -His-Leu- replacement of the normal -Ala-Gly- sequence at amino acid positions 5 and 6, which lie within a dispensable region of iso-1-cytochrome c; this mutation can accommodate the formation of a hairpin structure at the corresponding site in the mRNA. The amount of the altered protein was diminished to 20% of the wild-type level, whereas the amount of the mRNA remained normal. However, in contrast to the normal CYC1+ mRNA that is associated mainly with four to seven ribosomes, the bulk of the CYC1-239-O mRNA is associated with one to four ribosomes. These results suggest that the stable secondary structure within the translated region of the CYC1 mRNA diminishes translation by inhibiting elongation.
