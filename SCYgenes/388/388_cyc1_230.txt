Effects of amino acid replacements in yeast iso-1 cytochrome c on heme accessibility and intracomplex electron transfer in complexes with cytochrome c peroxidase.

The kinetics of reduction of wild type and several site-specific mutants of yeast iso-1 cytochrome c (Arg-13----Ile, Gln-16----Ser, Gln-16----Lys, Lys-27----Gln, Lys-72----Asp), both free and in 1:1 complexes with yeast cytochrome c peroxidase, by free flavin semiquinones have been studied. Intramolecular one-electron transfer from the ferrous cytochromes c to the H2O2-oxidized peroxidase at both low (8 mM) and high (275 mM) ionic strengths was also studied. The accessibility of the cytochrome c heme within the electrostatically stabilized complex and the rate constants for intramolecular electron transfer at both low and high ionic strength are highly dependent on the specific amino acids present at the protein-protein interface. Importantly, replacement by uncharged amino acids of Arg or Lys residues thought to be important in orientation and/or stabilization of the electron-transfer complex resulted in increased rates of electron transfer. In all cases, an increase in ionic strengths from 8 to 275 mM also produced increased intramolecular electron-transfer rate constants. The results suggest that the electrostatically stabilized 1:1 complex is not optimized for electron transfer and that by neutralization of key positively charged residues, or by an increase in the ionic strength thereby masking the ionic interactions, the two proteins can orient themselves to allow the formation of a more efficient electron-transfer complex.
