Antibody immunodiversity: a study on the marked specificity difference between two anti-yeast iso-1 cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies whose epitopes are closely related.

Anti-yeast iso-1 cytochrome c (cyt. c) monoclonal antibodies 2-96-12 and 4-74-6 have closely related epitopes (antigenic determinants). However, while the specificity of 4-74-6 is stringent, 2-96-12 cross-reacts with many evolutionarily related cytochromes c. Such a marked difference in specificity of antibodies with overlapping epitopes may represent unique antibody immunodiversity. Thus, we constructed Fv fragment models consisting of the variable domains of the heavy and light chains of 2-96-12 and 4-74-6 and that of another anti-iso-1 cyt. c as a control to gain insight into the origin of this difference in specificity. Our models show that 4-74-6 and 2-96-12 contain five and two aromatic side chains, respectively, in or near the central area of the antigen-combining site. The side chains of Arg95H (heavy chain) in 2-96-12 and Arg91L (light chain) in 4-74-6 project toward the central area of the combining site in our model. Antigen docking to our Fv models, combined with previous immunological studies, suggests that iso-1 cyt. c Asp60 may interact with Arg95H in 2-96-12 and Arg91L in 4-74-6 and that both epitopes of 2-96-12 and 4-74-7 may include iso-1 cyt. c Leu58, Asp60, Asn62, and Asn63. The effect of the Arg95H to Lys mutation on the antigen binding is also in accord with our model. The difference in specificity may be partly explained by a greater degree of conformational flexibility in and around the central area of the combining site in 2-96-12 compared to 4-74-6 due to differences in aromatic side chain packing.
