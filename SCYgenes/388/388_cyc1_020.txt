Interactions between yeast iso-1-cytochrome c and its peroxidase.

Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the formation of 19 complexes involving yeast iso-1-ferricytochrome c (Cc) and ferricytochrome c peroxidase (CcP). The complexes comprised combinations of the wild-type proteins, six CcP variants, and three Cc variants. Sixteen protein combinations were designed to probe the crystallographically defined interface between Cc and CcP. The data show that the high-affinity sites on Cc and CcP coincide with the crystallographically defined sites. Changing charged residues to alanine increases the enthalpy of complex formation by a constant amount, but the decrease in stability depends on the location of the amino acid substitution. Deleting methyl groups has a small effect on the binding enthalpy and a larger deleterious effect on the binding free energy, consistent with model studies of the hydrophobic effect, and showing that nonpolar interactions also stabilize the complex. Double-mutant cycles were used to determine the coupling energies for nine Cc-CcP residue pairs. Comparing these energies to the crystal structure of the complex leads to the conclusion that many of the substitutions induce a rearrangement of the complex.
