DNA unwinding in the CYC1 and DED1 yeast promoters.

The capacity of promoter DNA of two yeast genes to be unwound was studied. Both promoters, those of the CYC1 and DED1 genes, contain long oligopurine.oligopyrimidine (R.Y) tracts. The two promoters were cloned into negatively supercoiled plasmids, and their sensitivity to single-strand specific nuclease P1 was examined. Extensive P1 cleavage was located within the R.Y tracts, and cleavage sites were mapped. The extent of cleavage was only slightly dependent on P1 concentration, indicating a slow conversion of an intermediate form of DNA into the P1 reactive state. The cleavage required negative supercoiling and was suppressed by NaCl, MgCl2 and spermine. Two-dimensional topoisomer analysis showed that six superhelical turns were opened in the plasmids examined. The results indicate that at sufficient torsional stress, the R.Y tracts can intermittently undergo a transition into an unwound, ready-to-separate state. The oligopurine.oligopyrimidine tracts may thus serve as DNA unwinding centers in the gene promoters where they reside.
