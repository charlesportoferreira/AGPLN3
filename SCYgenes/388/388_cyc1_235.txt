Mutational analysis of upstream activation sequence 2 of the CYC1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a HAP2-HAP3-responsive site.

We analyzed upstream activation sequence 2 (UAS2), one of two independent UAS elements in the CYC1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletions and linker scanning mutations across the 87 base pairs previously defined as UAS2 showed two separate functional elements required for full activity. Region 1, from -230 to -200, contains the principal activation site and responds to the trans-acting regulatory loci HAP2 and HAP3. A portion of region 1 is homologous to two other HAP2-HAP3-responsive UASs and includes the G----A transition mutation UP1, which increases UAS2 activity. This consensus sequence TNATTGGT bears striking similarity to several CAAT box sequences of higher cells. Region 2, from -192 to -178, substantially enhances the activity of region 1, yet has little activity by itself. These regions bind distinct proteins found in crudely fractionated yeast extracts.
