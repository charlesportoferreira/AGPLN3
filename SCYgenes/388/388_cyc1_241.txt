Multiple base-pair mutations in yeast.

The nucleotide changes associated with both forward and reverse mutations at the CYC1 locus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been investigated by sequencing the mutated gene product, iso-1-cytochrome c and, more directly, by sequencing appropriate DNA segments. Although the majority of these mutations are the result of single base-pair changes, approximately 10% are the result of multiple mutations and these occur predominantly at certain sites and with certain patterns. Most multiple base-pair changes occur within 20 nucleotides of each other and are generally within six nucleotides. On the basis of the frequencies and patterns of mutations, these nucleotide changes are considered to have occurred as single, concerted events, rather than as multiple independent mutations. Analysis of these mutations indicates that multiple base-pair changes can arise by widely differing mechanisms. We have recognized the following classes of mutations: multiple base-pair changes that yield (1) direct repeats or (2) inverted repeats of local DNA sequences; (3) substitutions of two tandem base-pairs; (4) frameshift and contiguous single base-pair substitutions; and (5) recombination of the CYC1 gene with a non-allelic gene, resulting in alterations within contiguous segments that can be over 150 nucleotides in length. Some of the multiple base-pair changes do not fall into any of these categories. We suggest mechanisms to account for each of these five classes.
