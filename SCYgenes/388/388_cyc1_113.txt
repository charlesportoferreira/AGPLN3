Regulation of cytochrome c expression in the aerobic respiratory yeast Kluyveromyces lactis.

Transcriptional regulation of the KlCYC1 gene from the aerobic respiratory yeast Kluyveromyces lactis has been studied. The KlCYC1 gene produces two transcripts of different sizes, in contrast with the single transcripts found for CYC1 and CYC7 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and for the CYC gene from Schwanniomyces occidentalis. Both KlCYC1 transcripts respond in the same way to the regulatory signals studied here. The transcription of KlCYC1 is regulated by oxygen and this control is mediated by heme. The KlCYC1 gene is also subject to catabolite repression. Heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae mutants reveals that the factors HAP1 and HAP2 take part in the regulatory mechanism.
