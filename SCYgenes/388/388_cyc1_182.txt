NMR study of the structural characteristics of variants of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c in which unvaried aromatic residues have been substituted.

The structures of variants of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c, in which the previously unchanged Tyr48 and Tyr48 + Trp59 have been replaced by Phe, have been characterised by NMR. The NMR data indicated that the structures of the variant cytochromes c are very similar to the wild-type protein. In particular, the heme environment and interactions of the heme macrocycle were shown to be preserved. The observation of chemical shift differences have allowed for the assessment of conformational changes. The substitution of Trp59 by Phe may have caused a small conformational change, a manifestation of which is the observed chemical shift differences at His39, Val57 and Tyr74. The structural basis for the reduction in redox potential accompanying the amino acid substitutions is discussed and the proposal made that the changes in potential are a direct consequence of the side chain properties and do not result primarily from conformational changes.
