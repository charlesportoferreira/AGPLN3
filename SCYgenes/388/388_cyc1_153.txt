A study of core domains, and the core domain-domain interaction of cytochrome c fragment complex.

To gain insight into the folding mechanism of the cytochrome c complex, we prepared a complete set of homologous and hybrid two-fragment ferric complexes of four different types and related complexes from horse, tuna, yeast iso-l, and Candida cytochromes c. The complexes were characterized for structural properties. Apparent equilibrium constants of the complexes were determined to calculate delta G0 for binding. The results have allowed us to assign four core domains of the complex. A core domain is a structural region containing a hydrophobic core and the surrounding shell which folds and unfolds as a unit. Core domain 1 folds by itself and consists essentially of the right channel structure, found by R. E. Dickerson and colleagues, and a part of the heme. Core domains 2, 3, and 4, respectively, are assigned based on the cores located on the left (the Fe-S bond) and right sides and at the bottom of heme. Evidence of the core domain-domain interaction to stabilize the Fe-S bond, combined with the kinetic studies by G. R. Parr and H. Taniuchi, has led to a model of two alternative folding orders of the core domains for the horse type I complex: domain 1----3----2----4 or 1----2----3----4. Furthermore, delta G0 variation between the complexes has shown non-additive behavior, indicating the existence of a residue-residue interaction between the heme- and apofragments in the complex. Evidence suggests that this interaction in most cases occurs within or through the core groups of the ordered interface between the heme- and the apo-fragments formed by folding of core domains 1, 2, and 3. Evidence also suggests that such core group interaction manifests itself in the interaction to stabilize the Fe-S bond and may be manifested in the core domain-domain interaction.
