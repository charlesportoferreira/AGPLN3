Saccharomyces cerevisiae CYC1 mRNA 5'-end positioning: analysis by in vitro mutagenesis, using synthetic duplexes with random mismatch base pairs.

Expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CYC1 gene produces mRNA with more than 20 different 5' ends. A derivative of the CYC1 gene (CYC1-157) was constructed with a deletion of a portion of the CYC1 5'-noncoding region, which includes the sites at which many of the CYC1 mRNAs 5' ends map. A 54-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide homologous with the deleted sequence of CYC1-157 and which included a low level of random base pair mismatches (an average of two mismatches per duplex) was used to construct mutants of the CYC1 gene and examine the role of the DNA sequence at and immediately adjacent to the mRNA 5' ends in specifying their locations. The effect of these mutations on the site selection of mRNA 5' ends was examined by primer extension. Results indicate that there is a strong preference for 5' ends which align with an A residue (T in the template DNA strand) preceded by a short tract of pyrimidine residues.
