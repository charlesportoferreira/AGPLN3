Redundant 3' end-forming signals for the yeast CYC1 mRNA.

The cyc1-512 mutation is a 38-bp deletion in the 3' untranslated region of the CYC1 gene, which encodes iso-1-cytochrome c in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This deletion caused a 90% reduction in the levels of the CYC1 mRNA and protein because of the absence of the normal 3' end-forming signal. Although the 3' end-forming signal was not defined by previous analyses, we report that concomitant alteration by base-pair substitution of three 3' end-forming signals within and adjacent to the 38-bp region produced the same phenotype as the cyc1-512 mutation. Furthermore, these signals appear to be related to the previously identified 3' end-forming signal TATATA. A computer analysis revealed that TATATA and related sequences were present in the majority of 3' untranslated regions of yeast genes. Although TATATA may be the strongest and most frequently used signal in yeast genes, the CYC1+ gene concomitantly employed the weaker signals TT-TATA, TATGTT, and TATTTA, resulting in a strong signal.
