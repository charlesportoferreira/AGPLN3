RNA processing generates the mature 3' end of yeast CYC1 messenger RNA in vitro.

In whole cell extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, incubation of precursor mRNA transcripts encoding the sequences essential in vivo for forming the 3' end of the iso-1-cytochrome c mRNA (CYC1) revealed an endonuclease activity with the characteristics required for producing the mature mRNA 3' end. The observed cleavage in vitro is (i) accurate, occurring at or near the polyadenylation site of CYC1 RNA, (ii) 30 to 50 percent efficient, (iii) adenosine triphosphate dependent, (iv) specific for the 3' ends of at least two yeast pre-mRNA's, and (v) absent with related pre-mRNA's carrying mutations that abolish correct 3' end formation in vivo. In addition, a second activity in the extract polyadenylates the product under appropriate conditions. Thus, the mature 3' ends of yeast mRNA's may be generated by endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation rather than by transcription termination.
