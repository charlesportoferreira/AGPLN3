A highly revertible cyc1 mutant of yeast contains a small tandem duplication.

A mutant, cyc1-96, that reverts spontaneously at an extremely high rate, was uncovered after examining approximately 500 cyc1 mutants which lack or have defective iso-1-cytochrome c in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cloning and DNA sequencing of appropriate fragments revealed that the cyc1-96 mutation contained a 19 bp duplication whereas the spontaneously arising revertants contained the normal wild-type sequence. Because the 19 bp segment in the wild-type sequence is flanked by a 5 bp repeat and because the cyc1-96 mutation arose spontaneously, the 19 bp duplication may have arisen by slippage and misalignment during DNA synthesis. The high reversion rate was not diminished in strains containing the rad52 mutation, which generally reduces mitotic recombination, including recombination associated with the elimination of a segment of a long direct repeat. Thus the loss of segments from short and long duplications occur by different mechanisms. We suggest that the high reversion rates of cyc1-96 and other short duplications are due to misalignment errors during replication.
