PCF11 encodes a third protein component of yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor I.

Cleavage and polyadenylation factor I (CF I) is one of four factors required in vitro for yeast pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. Two protein components of this factor, encoded by genes RNA14 and RNA15, have already been identified. We describe here another gene, PCF11 (for protein 1 of CF I), that genetically interacts with RNA14 and RNA15 and which presumably codes for a third protein component of CF I. This gene was isolated in a two-hybrid screening designed to identify proteins interacting with Rna14 and Rna15. PCF11 is an essential gene encoding for a protein of 626 amino acids having an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. Thermosensitive mutations in PCF11 are synergistically lethal with thermosensitive alleles of RNA14 and RNA15. The Pcf11-2 thermosensitive strain shows a shortening of the poly(A) tails and a strong decrease in the steady-state level of actin transcripts after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature as do the thermosensitive alleles of RNA14 and RNA15. Extracts from the pcf11-1 and pcf11-2 thermosensitive strains and the wild-type strain, when Pcf11 is neutralized by specific antibodies, are deficient in cleavage and polyadenylation. Moreover, fractions obtained by anion-exchange chromatography of extracts from the wild-type strain contain both Pcf11 and Rna15 in the same fractions, as shown by immunoblotting with a Pcf11-specific antibody.
