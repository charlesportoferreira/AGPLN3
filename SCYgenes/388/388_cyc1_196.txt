Two types of TATA elements for the CYC1 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Functional TATA elements in the 5' untranslated region of the CYC1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been defined by transcriptional analysis of site-directed mutations. Five sites previously suggested to contain functional TATA elements were altered individually and in all possible combinations. The results indicated that only two elements are required for transcription at the normal level and the normal start sites. The two functional TATA elements are located at sites -178 and -123, where the A of the ATG start codon is assigned nucleotide position +1. They direct initiation within windows encompassing -70 to -46 and -46 to -28, respectively. Only when both of the upstream TATA sites were rendered nonfunctional were the third and fourth downstream TATA-like sequences activated, as indicated by the presence of low levels of transcription starting at -28. The two upstream functional TATA elements differed in sequence. The sequence of the most 5' one at site 1, denoted beta-type, was ATATATATAT, whereas that of the second one at site 2, denoted alpha-type, was TATATAAAA. The following rearrangements of the beta-type and alpha-type elements at two sites (1 and 2) were examined: site1 beta-site2 alpha; site 1 alpha-site 2 beta; site1 alpha-site2 alpha; and site1 beta-site2 beta. When different types were at different sites (site1 beta-site2 alpha and site1 alpha-site2 beta), both were used equally. In contrast, when the same type was present at both sites (site1 alpha-site2 alpha and site1 beta-site2 beta), only the upstream element was used. We suggest that the two TATA elements are recognized by different factors of the transcription apparatus.
