Degradation of cytochrome oxidase subunits in mutants of yeast lacking cytochrome c and suppression of the degradation by mutation of yme1.

We have confirmed by spectral analysis that cytochrome oxidase is not present in strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a primary deficiency in cytochrome c, and we have demonstrated by immunological procedures that such strains lack the mitochondrially encoded subunits I, II, and III of cytochrome oxidase. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that subunit II is rapidly degraded in vivo. This degradation can be at least partially suppressed by disruption of the nuclear gene YME1, which encodes a putative ATP-Zn(2+)-dependent protease. We suggest that the cytochrome oxidase subunits are not properly assembled in the absence of cytochrome c, and that Yme1 and possibly other proteases degrade the unassembled mitochondrial-encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase.
