Interaction of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with cytochrome c peroxidase investigated by [15N, 1H] heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.

The interaction of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with its physiological redox partner cytochrome c peroxidase has been investigated using heteronuclear NMR techniques. Chemical shift perturbations for both 15N and 1H nuclei arising from the interaction of isotopically enriched 15N cytochrome c with cytochrome c peroxidase have been observed. For the diamagnetic, ferrous cytochrome c, 34 amides are affected by binding, corresponding to residues at the front face of the protein and in agreement with the interface observed in the 1:1 crystal structure of the complex. In contrast, for the paramagnetic, ferric protein, 56 amides are affected, corresponding to residues both at the front and toward the rear of the protein. In addition, the chemical shift perturbations were larger for the ferric protein. Using experimentally observed pseudocontact shifts the magnetic susceptibility tensor of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c in both the free and bound forms has been calculated with HN nuclei as inputs. In contrast to an earlier study, the results indicate that there is no change in the geometry of the magnetic axes for cytochrome c upon binding to cytochrome c peroxidase. This leads us to conclude that the additional effects observed for the ferric protein arise either from a difference in binding mode or from the more flexible overall structure causing a transmittance effect upon binding.
