Rational design of a more stable yeast iso-1-cytochrome c.

Yeast iso-1-cytochrome c is one of the least stable mitochondrial cytochromes c. We have used a coordinated approach, combining the known functional and structural properties of cytochromes c, to engineer mutations into yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with the goal of selectively increasing the stability of the protein. The two redox forms of the native protein and six different mutant forms of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The relative stability, expressed as the difference in the Gibb's free energy of denaturation at a given temperature between the native and mutant forms (DeltaDeltaG(Tref)), was determined for each of the proteins. In both oxidation states, the mutant proteins C102T, T69E/C102T, T96A/C102T, and T69E/T96A/C102T were more stable than the wild-type protein, respectively. The increased stability of the mutant proteins is proposed to be due to the removal of a rare surface cysteine and the stabilization of two distorted alpha-helices.
