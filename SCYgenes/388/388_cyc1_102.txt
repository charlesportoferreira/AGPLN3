Enhanced stability in vivo of a thermodynamically stable mutant form of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c.

Previous work has established that the N57I amino acid replacement in iso-1-cytochrome c from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes an unprecedented increase in thermodynamic stability of the protein in vitro, whereas the N57G replacement diminishes stability. Spectrophotometric measurements of intact cells revealed that the N57I iso-1-cytochrome c is present at higher than normal levels in vivo. Although iso-1-cytochrome c turnover is negligible during aerobic growth, transfer of fully derepressed, aerobically grown cells to anaerobic growth conditions leads to reduction in the levels of all of the cytochromes. Pulse-chase experiments carried out under these anaerobic conditions demonstrated that the N57I iso-1-cytochrome c has a longer half-life than the normal protein. This is the first report of enhanced stability in vivo of a mutant form of a protein that has an enhanced thermodynamic stability in vitro. Although the N57I protein concentration is higher than the normal level, reduced growth in lactate medium indicated that the specific activity of this iso-1-cytochrome c in vivo is diminished relative to wild-type. On the other hand, the level of the thermodynamically labile N57G iso-1-cytochrome c was below normal. The in vivo levels of the N57I and N57G iso-1-cytochrome c suggest that proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space can be subjected to degradation, and that this degradation may play a role in controlling their normal levels.
