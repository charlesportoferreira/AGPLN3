Control of translation initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The first observations regarding the control of translation initiation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were made by Fred Sherman and his colleagues in 1971. Elegant genetic studies of the CYC1 gene resulted in the formulation of 'Sherman's Rules' for translation initiation as follows: (i) AUG is the only initiator codon. (ii) the most proximal AUG from the 5' end of a message will serve as the start site of translation; and (iii) if the upstream AUG codon is mutated then initiation begins at the next available AUG in the message. Hidden within these rules is the mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation, as these very same rules were later shown to apply to higher eukaryotic organisms and were formulated into the scanning model. However, only in the past five years has yeast been taken seriously as an organism for studying the mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation. The basis for this is that the yeast genes for at least four mammalian translation initiation factor homologues have been identified and the number is growing. Similar factors suggest similar mechanisms for translation initiation between yeast and mammals. For some translation initiation factors, the genetics of yeast has provided new insights into their function. A mechanism for regulating translation initiation in mammalian cells is now evident in yeast. It seems clear that the molecular genetics of yeast coupled with the available in vitro translation system will provide a wealth of information in the future regarding translational control and regulatory mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is known about translational control in S. cerevisiae.
