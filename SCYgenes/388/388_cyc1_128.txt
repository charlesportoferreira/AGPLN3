Mutations of iso-1-cytochrome c at positions 13 and 90. Separate effects on physical and functional properties.

Residues at positions 13 (lysine or arginine) and 90 (glutamate or aspartate) of eukaryotic cytochromes c have been conserved during evolution; Cys102, however, is found only in yeast cytochrome c. The positively charged residue at position 13 and the negatively charged residue at position 90 are close together in those cytochromes c for which three-dimensional structures are available. We have replaced the amino acids at these two positions by cysteine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-cytochrome c; in an earlier study, Cys102 was replaced by threonine without negatively influencing the physical or enzymic properties of the protein. The mutated proteins [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c (iso-1-cytochrome c containing Arg13--&gt;Cys and Cys102--&gt;Thr mutations), [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c (iso-1-cytochrome c containing Asp90--&gt;Cys and Cys102--&gt;Thr mutations) and [R13C, D90C, C102T]cytochrome c (iso-1-cytochrome c containing Arg13--&gt;Cys, Asp90--&gt;Cys, and Cys102--&gt;Thr mutations) are functional in vivo. Free sulfhydryl titration shows that the doubly mutated forms each contain one sulfhydryl group while the triple mutant contains two sulfhydryl groups. The stability of mutant [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c resembles that of [C102T] cytochrome c, whereas the stability of [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c resembles the stability of [R13C, D90C, C102T]cytochrome c. The activity of cytochrome-c oxidase using cytochrome c was monitored polarographically. Compared to the wild-type or [C102T]cytochrome c, which shows two kinetic phases with cytochrome-c oxidase, [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c has much the same profile; [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c and [R13C, D90C, C102T]cytochrome c exhibit one kinetic phase with decreased activity. Electron-transfer activity of the mutant cytochromes c is inhibited by Hg2+. The inhibition is highest for the triple mutant, less for [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c, even less for [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c and insignificant for the wild type. It would appear as though the stability of the triple mutant follows the changes that result from the Asp90--&gt;Cys mutation while the activity changes follow those of the Arg13--&gt;Cys mutation.
