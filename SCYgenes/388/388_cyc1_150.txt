Signals that produce 3' termini in CYC1 mRNA of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The cyc1-512 mutant was previously shown to contain a 38-bp deletion, 8 nucleotides upstream from the major wild-type poly(A) site, in the CYC1 gene, which encodes iso-1-cytochrome c of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This 38-bp deletion caused a 90% reduction in the CYC1 transcripts, which were heterogeneous in size, aberrantly long, and presumably labile (K. S. Zaret and F. Sherman, Cell 28:563-573, 1982). Site-directed mutagenesis in and adjacent to the 38-bp region was used to identify signals involved in the formation and positioning of CYC1 mRNA 3' ends. In addition, combinations of various putative 3' end-forming signals were introduced by in vitro mutagenesis into the 3' region of the cyc1-512 mutant. The combined results from both studies suggest that 3' end formation in yeast cells involves signals having the following three distinct but integrated elements acting in concert: (i) the upstream element, including sequences TATATA, TAG ... TATGTA, and TTTTTATA, which function by enhancing the efficiency of downstream elements; (ii) downstream elements, such as TTAAGAAC and AAGAA, which position the poly(A) site; and (iii) the actual site of polyadenylation, which often occurs after cytidine residues that are 3' to the so-called downstream element. While the upstream element is required for efficient 3' end formation, alterations of the downstream element and poly(A) sites generally do not affect the efficiency of 3' end formation but appear to alter the positions of poly(A) sites. In addition, we have better defined the upstream elements by examining various derivatives of TATATA and TAG ... TATGTA, and we have examined the spatial requirements of the three elements by systematically introducing or deleting upstream and downstream elements and cytidine poly(A) sites.
