Equilibrium thermodynamics of a physiologically-relevant heme-protein complex.

We used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the equilibrium thermodynamics for formation of the physiologically-relevant redox protein complex between yeast ferricytochrome c and yeast ferricytochrome c peroxidase. A 1:1 binding stoichiometry was observed, and the binding free energies agree with results from other techniques. The binding is either enthalpy- or entropy-driven depending on the conditions, and the heat capacity change upon binding is negative. Increasing the ionic strength destabilizes the complex, and both the binding enthalpy and entropy increase. Increasing the temperature stabilizes the complex, indicating a positive van't Hoff binding enthalpy, yet the calorimetric binding enthalpy is negative (-1.4 to -6.2 kcal mol(-)(1)). We suggest that this discrepancy is caused by solvent reorganization in an intermediate state. The measured enthalpy and heat capacity changes are in reasonable agreement with the values estimated from the surface area change upon complex formation. These results are compared to those for formation of the horse ferricytochrome c/yeast ferricytochrome c peroxidase complex. The results suggest that the crystal and solution structures for the yeast complex are the same, while the crystal and solution structures for horse cytochrome c/yeast cytochrome c peroxidase are different.
