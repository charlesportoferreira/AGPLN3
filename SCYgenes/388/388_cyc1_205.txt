One- and two-dimensional proton NMR studies of cys-102 S-methylated yeast isozyme-1 ferricytochrome c.

The effect of S-methylating cysteine-102 (cys-102) (SH----SSCH3) of yeast isozyme-1 (iso-1) ferricytochrome c has been studied using proton NMR spectroscopy. COSY, NOESY, and one-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) difference spectroscopies have all been used. The NMR spectrum of this derivative is very similar to that of native yeast iso-1 ferricytochrome c. The advantage of using the cys-102 S-methylated derivative is that it is unable to spontaneously dimerize in solution, like native iso-1 monomer does. This makes the derivative a simple, ideal protein for long NMR experiments. This work yields many proton resonance assignments for S-methylated yeast iso-1 monomer and confirms all of the assignments for iso-1 monomer that were previously made using only the one-dimensional NOE method.
