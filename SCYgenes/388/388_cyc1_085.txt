Loop replacement and random mutagenesis of omega-loop D, residues 70-84, in iso-1-cytochrome c.

To study the role of omega loop D, residues 70-84, in the structure and function of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c, this loop was replaced with homologous and heterologous loops. A novel method was developed for rapid insertion of these mutations into the yeast chromosome at the CYC1 locus. The strains containing these loop replacement cytochromes cannot grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, indicating that the proteins are nonfunctional. Whole cell difference spectroscopy shows that no holocytochrome c is present; however, apoprotein is found by immunoblot analysis. Thus, apoprotein is present in these mutant strains, but it cannot bind heme and cannot compete with wild type apoprotein conversion to holoprotein. This is a unique example of a set of loop replacements that do not produce folded protein, and these results suggest that the loop D amino acid sequence in iso-1-cytochrome c plays a significant role in cytochrome c biosynthesis in vivo. To identify the significant amino acids in loop D, random mutagenesis of six highly conserved loop residues, Tyr-74, Ile-75, Pro-76, Gly-77, Thr-78, and Lys-79, was accomplished. Sequencing of the random mutants shows that strict conservation of none of these residues is required to produce a minimally functional cytochrome c. Preferences are found for small, hydrophilic or aromatic residues at position 74, hydrophobic residues at position 75, glycine and arginine at positions 76 and 77, and beta-branched amino acids at position 78. Implications for the role of loop D in the structure and function of iso-1-cytochrome c are discussed.
