Mutational alterations induced in yeast by ionizing radiation.

The cycl-9 ochre (UAA) mutant and the cycl-179 amber (UAG) mutant of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were reverted with X-rays and alpha-particles. The amino acid sequence changes of iso-1-cytochromes c from 36 of the intragenic revertants were determined by amino acid analysis and peptide mapping, aided by partial amino acid sequencing of 4 revertants. In addition, the DNA segments encompassing 3 unusual mutations with complex changes were cloned and sequenced. This study and previous studies of 16 other revertants of cycl-9 and cycl-179 revealed that ionizing radiation primarily induces single base-pair substitutions; 47 of the 52 revertants arose by transversions and transitions without any apparent preference. However, the A X T----T X A substitution at the first base pair for the cycl-179 UAG codon, leading to the normal protein, was not detected, nor was it found previously in 32 revertants of cycl-179 obtained spontaneously or induced with various other mutagens; apparently, there is a prohibition of certain base-pair substitutions at certain sites in DNA. In addition, 5 of the 52 revertants arose by multiple changes within a short region of 11 base pairs. These consisted of the deletion of 6 base pairs, the substitution of 3 base pairs, and 3 different kinds of substitutions of two base pairs. Compared to other mutagens previously tested with the cycl system, ionizing radiation produces the most random types of base-pair substitutions.
