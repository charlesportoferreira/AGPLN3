Stabilizing amino acid replacements at position 52 in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c: in vivo and in vitro effects.

Position 52 of iso-1-cytochrome c in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was systematically replaced with all possible amino acids to investigate the molecular basis of the &quot;global suppressor&quot; activity for the N52I mutation. Isogenic strains containing the variant proteins were made with a mixed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis technique in vivo. A relationship between thermodynamic protein stability and cellular protein levels was established by comparing direct spectroscopic measurements of cytochrome c levels in vivo with the thermodynamic parameters from guanidine hydrochloride denaturation and microcalorimetric measurements. Reversible denaturation data show that, within a large group of amino acid side chains, the thermodynamic stabilization at position 52 is related to the hydrophobicity of the side chain at that site.
