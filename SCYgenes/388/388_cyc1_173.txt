Further investigations regarding the role of trimethyllysine for cytochrome c uptake into mitochondria.

1. A mutant of the iso-1-cytochrome c gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been constructed which contains an Arg codon, replacing the normal trimethylated Lys at position 77. 2. This mutated gene was cloned into a pGem 1 vector and used for the in vitro translation of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c. 3. Utilizing an in vitro mitochondria binding assay, it was found that the mutant cytochrome c could transverse the yeast mitochondrial membrane, however the amount of protein incorporated was 3-fold less that of the trimethylated wild type. 4. Omission of the protein methyltransferase from assays containing the wild type cytochrome c caused only a slight reduction (15%) in the amount of protein incorporated. 5. These results suggest while the lysine residue 77 of apocytochrome c is important for mitochondria uptake, the methylation of this residue seems to play a relatively minor role.
