RNA polymerase II holoenzyme recruitment is sufficient to remodel chromatin at the yeast PHO5 promoter.

We examine transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling at the PHO5 promoter in yeast by fusion proteins that are thought to act by recruiting the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to DNA in the absence of a classic activating region. These hybrid proteins (e.g., Gal11+Pho4 or Gal4(58-97)+Pho4 in the presence of a GAL11P allele) efficiently activated transcription and remodeled chromatin. Similar chromatin remodeling was observed at a PHO5 promoter deleted for TATA and thus unable to support transcription. We conclude that recruitment of the holoenzyme or associated proteins suffices for chromatin remodeling. We also show that the SWI/SNF complex is required neither for efficient transcription of the wild-type PHO5 nor the GAL1 promoters, and we observe nearly complete chromatin remodeling at PHO5 in the absence of Snf2.
