Different classes of polyadenylation sites in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

This report provides an analysis of the function of polyadenylation sites from six different genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These sites were tested for their ability to turn off read-through transcription into the URA3 gene in vivo when inserted into an ACT-URA3 fusion gene. The 3' ends of all polyadenylation sites inserted into the test system in their natural configuration are identical to the 3' ends of the chromosomal genes. We identified two classes of polyadenylation sites: (i) efficient sites (originating from the genes GCN4 and PHO5) that were functional in a strict orientation-dependent manner and (ii) bidirectional sites (derived from ARO4, TRP1, and TRP4) that had a distinctly reduced efficiency. The ADH1 polyadenylation site was efficient and bidirectional and was shown to be a combination of two polyadenylation sites of two convergently transcribed genes. Sequence comparison revealed that all efficient unidirectional polyadenylation sites contain the sequence TTTTTAT, whereas all bidirectional sites have the tripartite sequence TAG...TA (T)GT...TTT. Both sequence elements have previously been proposed to be involved in 3' end formation. Site-directed point mutagenesis of the TTTTTAT sequence had no effect, whereas mutations within the tripartite sequence caused a reduced efficiency for 3' end formation. The tripartite sequence alone, however, is not sufficient for 3' end formation, but it might be part of a signal sequence in the bidirectional class of yeast polyadenylation sites. Our findings support the assumption that there are at least two different mechanisms with different sequence elements directing 3' end formation in yeast.
