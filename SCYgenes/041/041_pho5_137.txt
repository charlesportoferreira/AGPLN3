Characterization of the gene for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Sequence, protein homology, and expression during growth on glucose.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The predicted protein sequence for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from S. cerevisiae contains 347 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 38,100; that from S. pombe, contains 346 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 38,380. Comparison of these amino acid sequences with each other and that of pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase shows several regions of strong homology separated by regions of divergence. These homologous regions are likely candidates for functional domains. A gene cassette was constructed for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from S. cerevisiae and the gene cassette expressed from the regulated PHO5 and GAL1 promoters of yeast. Yeast cells expressing fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, while growing on glucose, accumulated large amounts of enzyme intracellularly, suggesting that glucose-regulated proteolytic inactivation does not operate efficiently under these conditions. Growth on glucose was not inhibited by the expression of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.
