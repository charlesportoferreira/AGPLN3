A DNA fragment containing the upstream activator sequence determines nucleosome positioning of the transcriptionally repressed PHO5 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The functional relationship of nucleosome positioning and gene expression is not known. Using high-copy plasmids, containing the yeast phosphate-repressible acid phosphatase gene (PHO5) and the TRP1/ARS1 vector system, I have determined the nucleosomal structure of the 5' region of the PHO5 gene and demonstrated that the nucleosomal positioning of this region is independent of orientation or position in the various plasmid constructions utilized. However, deletion of a 278-base pair BamHI-ClaI fragment from the 5'-flanking sequences of the PHO5 gene causes the nucleosome positioning to become dependent on orientation or position in the plasmids tested. Use of PHO5-CYC1-lACZ fusions have demonstrated that this DNA fragment contains the sequences responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the PHO5 gene in response to the level of phosphate in the growth media. The nucleosome positioning in the 5' region of PHO5 may be determined by an interaction with the sequences or machinery responsible for transcriptional regulation of the gene.
