The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADE1 gene: structure, overexpression and possible regulation by general amino acid control.

The ADE1 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been cloned by complementation of the ade1 mutation. The nucleotide sequence has been determined for the 918-bp coding region, 240-bp 5'-noncoding region and 292-bp 3'-noncoding region. The sequenced region includes a single large open reading frame coding for a protein of 306 amino acid (aa) residues. The promoter of the ADE1 gene contains a copy of the 5'-TGACTC hexanucleotide, a feature characteristic of promoters under general aa control. Subsequent search of other published purine biosynthesis gene sequences revealed that all of them also contain general aa control signals in their promoter regions. An expression plasmid containing the ADE1 coding region under control of the PHO5 promoter produced N-succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) synthetase in yeast cells at a level of 40% of total cellular protein. One-step purification resulted in an almost homogeneous preparation of SAICAR synthetase.
