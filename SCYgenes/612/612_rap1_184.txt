Conditional silencing: the HMRE mating-type silencer exerts a rapidly reversible position effect on the yeast HSP82 heat shock gene.

The HMRE silencer of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been previously shown to transcriptionally repress class II and class III genes integrated within the HMR silent mating-type locus up to 2.6 kb away. Here we study the ability of this element to repress at an ectopic position, independent of sequences normally associated with it. When integrated 750 bp upstream of the HSP82 heat shock gene, the silencer represses basal-level transcription approximately 5-fold but has no effect on chemical- or heat-shock-induced expression. Such conditional silencing is also seen when the HMRE/HSP82 allele is carried on a centromeric episome or when the entire HMRa domain is transplaced 2.7 kb upstream of HSP82. Notably, the a1 promoter within the immigrant HMRa locus remains fully repressed at the same time HSP82 is derepressed. The position effect mediated by the E silencer is absolutely dependent on the presence of a functional SIR4 gene product, is lost within 1 min following stress induction, and is fully reestablished within 15 min following a return to nonstressful conditions. Similar kinetics of reestablishment are seen in HMRE/HSP82 and HMRa/HSP82 strains, indicating that complete repression can be mediated over thousands of base pairs within minutes. DNase I chromatin mapping reveals that the ABF1, RAP1, and autonomously replicating sequence factor binding sites within the silencer are constitutively occupied in chromatin, unaltered by heat shock or the presence of SIR4. Similarly, the heat shock factor binding site upstream of HSP82 remains occupied under such conditions, suggesting concurrent occupancy of silencer and activator binding sites. Our results are consistent with a model in which silencing at the HMRE/HSP82 allele is mediated by direct or indirect contacts between the silencer protein complex and heat shock factor.
