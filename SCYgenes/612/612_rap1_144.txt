Approaching the function of new genes by detection of their potential upstream activation sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: application to chromosome III.

The systematic sequencing of the yeast genome reveals the presence of many potential genes of unknown function. One way to approach their function is to define which regulatory system controls their transcription. This can also be accomplished by the detection of an upstream activation sequence (UAS). Such a detection can be done by computer, provided that the definition of a UAS includes sufficient and precise rules. We have established such rules for the UASs of the GAL4, RAP1 (RPG box), GCN4, and the HAP2/HAP3/HAP4 regulatory proteins, as well as for a motif (PAC) frequently found upstream of the genes of the RNA polymerase A and C subunits. These rules were applied to the chromosome III DNA sequence, and gave precise predictions.
