Repression of rRNA synthesis due to a secretory defect requires the C-terminal silencing domain of Rap1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

A secretory defect causes specific transcriptional repression of both ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA genes, suggesting the coupling of plasma membrane and ribosome syntheses. We previously reported that the rap1-17 allele, which produced C-terminally truncated Rap1p, derepressed transcription of ribosomal protein genes when the secretory pathway was blocked. In this paper, we demonstrate that the rap1-17 mutation also leads to significant attenuation of transcriptional repression of rRNA genes due to a secretory defect. In contrast, the rap1-2 temperature-sensitive allele containing a unique missense mutation in the middle of the coding sequence has only a weak effect on repression. These results suggest that the C-terminal silencing domain of Rap1p is required for transcriptional repression of rDNA in response to a secretory defect. We also demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of ribosomal protein genes in response to nitrogen limitation was not affected by the rap1-17 allele, suggesting that the mechanism of nitrogen response is distinct from that of the secretory response.
