Proline biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: molecular analysis of the PRO1 gene, which encodes gamma-glutamyl kinase.

The PRO1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the 428-amino-acid protein gamma-glutamyl kinase (ATP:L-glutamate 5-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.11), which catalyzes the first step in proline biosynthesis. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed significant homology between the yeast and Escherichia coli gamma-glutamyl kinases throughout their lengths. Four close matches to the consensus sequence for GCN4 protein binding and one close match to the RAP1 protein-binding site were found in the PRO1 upstream region. The response of the PRO1 gene to changes in the growth medium was analyzed by measurement of steady-state mRNA levels and of beta-galactosidase activity encoded by a PRO1-lacZ gene fusion. PRO1 expression was not repressed by exogenous proline and was not induced by the presence of glutamate in the growth medium. Although expression of the PRO1 gene did not change in response to histidine starvation, both steady-state PRO1 mRNA levels and beta-galactosidase activities were elevated in a gcd1 strain and reduced in a gcn4 strain. In addition, a pro1 bradytrophic strain became completely auxotrophic for proline in a gcn4 strain background. These results indicate that PRO1 is regulated by the general amino acid control system.
