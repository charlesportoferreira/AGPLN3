RAP, RAP, open up! New wrinkles for RAP1 in yeast.

RAP1 (repressor/activator protein 1) from budding yeast is well known for its involvement in gene activation and repression, telomere structure and function, and replication. Recent studies have examined additional roles for RAP1 in heterochromatin boundary-element formation, creation of hotspots for meiotic recombination, and chromatin opening. These studies provide new insight into the ability of this abundant DNA-binding protein to participate in a diverse array of functions taking place in a chromatin environment.
