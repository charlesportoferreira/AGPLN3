Isolation of a Candida glabrata homologue of RAP1, a regulator of transcription and telomere function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

To study the function of RAP1, an essential gene involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation, silencing and the telomere function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated a Candida glabrata gene that complements the growth defect of a S. cerevisiae rap1 conditional mutant. The DNA sequence of the cloned gene, which we designated CgRAP1, predicted a 2064 bp open reading frame encoding a 687 amino acid protein with an overall identity of 65% and a similarity of 78% to Rap1p from S. cerevisiae.
