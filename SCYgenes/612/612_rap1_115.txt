The multifunctional transcription factors Abf1p, Rap1p and Reb1p are required for full transcriptional activation of the chromosomal PGK gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

We have identified two new transcription factor binding sites upstream of the previously defined UAS within the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These sites are bound in vitro by the multifunctional factors Cpf1p and Reb1p. We have generated targeted deletions of Rap1p, Abf1p and Reb1p binding sites in the promoter of the chromosomal copy of the PGK gene. Northern blot analysis confirmed that most PGK promoter activity is mediated through the Rap1p binding site. However, significant effects are also mediated through both the Reb1p and Abf1p sites. In contrast, when the promoter is present on a high-copy-number plasmid, both the Abf1p and Reb1p sites play no role in transcriptional activation. The role of Cpf1p was examined using a cpf1 null strain. Cpf1p was found to have little if any, effect on activation of either the chromosomal or plasmid-borne PGK gene.
