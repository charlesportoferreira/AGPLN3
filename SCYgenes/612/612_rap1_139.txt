Meiosis-specific double-strand DNA breaks at the HIS4 recombination hot spot in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: control in cis and trans.

The region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III located between the 5' end of the HIS4 gene and the 3' end of the adjacent BIK1 gene has a very high level of meiotic recombination. In wild-type strains, a meiosis-specific double-strand DNA break occurs in the hot spot region. This break is absent in strains in which the transcription factors Rap1p, Bas1p, and Bas2p cannot bind to the region upstream of HIS4. In strains with levels of recombination that are higher than those of the wild type, the break is found at elevated levels. The linear relationship between hot spot activity and the frequency of double-strand DNA breaks suggests that these lesions are responsible for initiating recombination at the HIS4 recombination hot spot.
