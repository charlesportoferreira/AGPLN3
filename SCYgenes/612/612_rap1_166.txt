In vitro identification of a protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that interacts specifically with the G-rich DNA strand of the telomere.

The telomeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae consist of a repeated G2-3T(GT)1-6 DNA sequence that forms a complex with proteins. To date only the RAP1 protein has been shown to bind to the simple sequences in yeast telomeric DNA, as well as to non-telomeric regulatory sites. We have used synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, both double- and single-stranded, to identify specific yeast telomeric proteins in a partially purified yeast extract. Using the gel shift assay, we detected a binding activity that is stable at high ionic strength and that recognizes specifically the G-rich protrusion of a double-stranded synthetic yeast telomere, as well as the G-rich single strand. This is the first evidence of a purely telomeric protein in that it binds to the single-stranded telomeric protrusion of the yeast chromosome.
