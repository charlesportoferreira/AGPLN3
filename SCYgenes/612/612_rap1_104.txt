Telomeres, not the end of the story.

Transcription in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals is subject to chromosomal position effects that result in heritable and variegated patterns of gene expression. Two recent studies have employed a reversible protein-DNA crosslinking method to identify the structural components of heterochromatin in budding yeast. The results show that a complex containing the proteins Rap1, Sir2p, Sir3p and Sir4p is physically associated with nucleosomes at telomere proximal regions, but that the repressive chromatin structure extended by Sir3p overexpression has a different composition.
