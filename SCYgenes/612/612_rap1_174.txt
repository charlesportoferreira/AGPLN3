Genetic evidence that the meiotic recombination hotspot at the HIS4 locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not represent a site for a symmetrically processed double-strand break.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the binding of the Rap1 protein to a site located between the 5' end of the HIS4 gene and the 3' end of BIK1 stimulates meiotic recombination at both flanking loci. By using strains that contain mutations located in HIS4 and BIK1, we found that most recombination events stimulated by the binding of Rap1 involve HIS4 or BIK1, rather than bidirectional events including both loci. The patterns of aberrant segregation indicate that most of the Rap1-stimulated recombination events do not represent the symmetric processing of a double-strand DNA break located at the Rap1-binding site.
