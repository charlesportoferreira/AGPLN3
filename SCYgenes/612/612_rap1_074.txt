Sir3p domains involved in the initiation of telomeric silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that tethering of Sir3p at the subtelomeric/telomeric junction restores silencing in strains containing Rap1-17p, a mutant protein unable to recruit Sir3p. This tethered silencing assay serves as a model system for the early events that follow recruitment of silencing factors, a process we term initiation. A series of LexA fusion proteins in-frame with various Sir3p fragments were constructed and tested for their ability to support tethered silencing. Interestingly, a region comprising only the C-terminal 144 amino acids, termed the C-terminal domain (CTD), is both necessary and sufficient for restoration of silencing. Curiously, the LexA-Sir3(N205) mutant protein overcomes the requirement for the CTD, possibly by unmasking a cryptic initiation site. A second domain spanning amino acids 481-835, termed the nonessential for initiation domain (NID), is dispensable for the Sir3p function in initiation, but is required for the recruitment of the Sir4p C terminus. In addition, in the absence of the N-terminal 481 amino acids, the NID negatively influences CTD activity. This suggests the presence of a third region, consisting of the N-terminal half (1-481) of Sir3p, termed the positive regulatory domain (PRD), which is required to initiate silencing in the presence of the NID. These data suggest that the CTD &quot;active&quot; site is under both positive and negative control mediated by multiple Sir3p domains.
