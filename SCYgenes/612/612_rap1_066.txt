Kluyveromyces lactis HIS4 transcriptional regulation: similarities and differences to Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS4 gene.

Sequence analysis of the Kluyveromyces lactis HIS4 (KlHIS4) gene promoter reveals relevant differences in comparison to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS4 homologous gene. Among them are the absence of a Rap1 binding site and the presence of only three putative Gcn4 binding consensus sites instead of the five described in the S. cerevisiae promoter. Since these factors are implicated in the general control, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the KlHIS4 gene under conditions of amino acid starvation and discovered that the mechanisms previously described for S. cerevisiae HIS4 regulation and related to general control are not functional in K. lactis. The expression analysis of the KlHIS4 gene under phosphate starvation or high adenine supply shows that factors, such as Bas1 or Bas2, involved in the basal control may also operate in a different way in K. lactis. Interestingly, and also in contrast to the HIS4 regulation in S. cerevisiae, we found domains for Nit2-like and yeast-Ap1-like binding sequences. Northern analyses showed transcriptional activation under ammonia starvation and oxidative stress.
