The different (sur)faces of Rap1p.

The DNA-binding protein Rap1p fulfills many different functions in the yeast cell. It targets 5% of the promoters, acting both as a transcriptional activator and as a repressor, depending on the DNA sequence context. In addition, Rap1p is an essential structural component of yeast telomeres, where it contributes to telomeric silencing. Here we review the evidence indicating that Rap1p function is modulated by the precise architecture of the its binding site and its surroundings: long tracts of telomeric repeats for telomeric functions, specific sequences and orientation for maximal transcriptional activation, and specific DNA recognition sequences for complementary factors in other cases. Many of these functions are probably related to chromatin organization around Rap1p DNA binding sites, resulting from the very tight binding of Rap1p to DNA. We propose that Rap1p alters its structure to bind to different versions of its DNA binding sequence. These structural changes may modulate the function of Rap1p domains, providing different interacting surfaces for binding to specific co-operating factors, and thus contributing to the diversity of Rap1p function.
