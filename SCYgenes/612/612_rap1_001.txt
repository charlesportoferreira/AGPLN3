Functional analysis of CaRAP1, encoding the Repressor/activator protein 1 of Candida albicans.

The RAP1 gene (repressor/activator protein 1) encodes a transcription factor and telomere binding protein that is essential for viability in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genome sequence of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans contains a RAP1 homologue. We generated C. albicans mutants in which both RAP1 alleles were deleted. The Deltarap1 mutants grew as well as the wild-type parental strain and formed normal germ tubes and hyphae in response to a variety of inducing conditions. However, under conditions that promote budding yeast growth in the wild-type strain, the Deltarap1 mutants formed both yeast and pseudohyphal cells. This phenotype was reverted upon reintroduction of a functional RAP1 copy. Our results demonstrate that RAP1 is a non-essential gene in C. albicans which is required to repress the formation of pseudohyphae under conditions favouring growth as budding yeast.
