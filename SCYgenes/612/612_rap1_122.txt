Highly conserved toxicity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p.

Budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Rap1p has been expressed in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) under the control of the regulatable fructose bisphosphatase (fbp) promoter. When the fbp promoter was derepressed, cells containing the complete RAP1 gene failed to show any significant growth, suggesting that Rap1p is toxic. A derivative of Rap1p that has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the DNA-binding domain was not toxic in cells grown at 37 degrees C, a temperature at which DNA binding by rap1p(ts) is severely inhibited. Removal of a short region downstream of the DNA-binding domain, including a region previously shown to be essential for Rap1p toxicity in budding yeast, also abolished the toxic effect. The toxic effect of Rap1p has therefore been conserved between two distantly related yeasts. In budding yeast, overexpression of Rap1p also caused changes to the lengths of the telomeric repeats. No effects on telomeres were detected in fission yeast.
