Specific binding of TUF factor to upstream activation sites of yeast ribosomal protein genes.

Transcription activation of yeast ribosomal protein genes is mediated through homologous, 12-nucleotide-long and, in general, duplicated upstream promoter elements (HOMOL1 and RPG, referred to as UASrpg). As shown previously, a yeast protein factor, TUF, interacts specifically with these conserved boxes in the 5'-flanking sequences of the elongation factor genes TEF1 and TEF2 and the ribosomal protein gene RP51A. We have now extended our studies of TUF-UASrpg binding by analysing--using footprinting and gel electrophoretic retardation techniques--the genes encoding the ribosomal proteins L25, rp28 (both copy genes), S24 + L46 and S33. Most, but not all, conserved sequence elements occurring in front of these genes, turned out to represent binding sites for the same factor, TUF. The two functionally important boxes that are found in a tandem arrangement (a characteristic of many rp genes) upstream of the L25 gene are indistinguishable in their factor binding specificity. Large differences were shown to exist in the affinity of the TUF factor for the various individual boxes and in the half-life of the protein-DNA complexes. No binding cooperativity could be demonstrated on adjacent sites on L25 or RP51A promoters. Based on binding data, the UASrpg sequence ACACCCATACAT appears to be the one recognized most efficiently by the TUF factor. Previously, no conserved box was found in front of the gene encoding S33. Nevertheless, complex formation with the protein fraction used was observed in the upstream region of the S33 gene. Competition experiments disclosed the existence of an additional binding component, distinct from TUF. This component may possibly regulate a subset of genes for the translational apparatus.
