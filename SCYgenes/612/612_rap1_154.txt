Yeast intragenic transcriptional control: activation and repression sites within the coding region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LPD1 gene.

Though widely recognized in higher eukaryotes, the regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II by proteins that bind within the coding sequence remains largely speculative. We have shown for the LPD1 gene, encoding lipoamide dehydrogenase, that the coding sequence between +13 and +469 activated gene expression of an LPD1::lacZ fusion by up to sixfold in the presence of the upstream promoter. This downstream region, inserted upstream of a promoterless CYC1::lacZ fusion, activated gene expression in a carbon source-dependent manner by a factor of 15 to 111, independent of orientation. Deletion and mutational analysis identified two downstream activation sites (DAS1 and DAS2) and two downstream repressor sites (DRS1 and DRS2) that influence the rate of LPD1 transcription rather than mRNA degradation or translation. Activation from the DAS1 region (positions +137 to +191), encompassing a CDEI-like element, is twofold under derepressive conditions. Activation from DAS2 (+291 to +296), a CRE-like motif, is 12-fold for both repressed and derepressed states. DRS1, a pair of adjacent and opposing ABF1 sites (+288 to +313), is responsible for a 1.3- to 2-fold repression of transcription, depending on the carbon source. DRS1 requires the concerted action of DRS2 (a RAP1 motif at position +406) for repression of transcription only when the gene is induced. Gel mobility shift analysis and in vitro footprinting have shown that proteins bind in vitro to these downstream elements.
