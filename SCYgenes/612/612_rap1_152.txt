RAP1: a protean regulator in yeast.

The yeast protein RAP1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that binds to many promoters, to two elements that silence mating-type genes, and to [(C)1-3A]n tracts at telomeres. RAP1 is essential for cell viability and can function as either an activator or a repressor of transcription, depending upon the context of its binding site. Recent experiments suggest that its function may be determined by different sets of protein-protein interactions at promoters and silencers. At the ends of chromosomes, RAP1 plays an important role in both silencing (telomere position effect) and telomere structure.
