The sequence of a 13.5 kb DNA segment from the left arm of yeast chromosome XIV reveals MER1; RAP1; a new putative member of the DNA replication complex and a new putative serine/threonine phosphatase gene.

The nucleotide sequence of two adjacent ClaI fragments from the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XIV has been determined. Analysis of the 13,520 bp DNA segment reveals nine open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 300 bp. N1302 contains the consensus sequence for a phosphate-binding loop common to ATP- and GTP-binding proteins and a strictly conserved 'SRC' sequence of unknown function present in all accessory proteins of replicative polymerases. N1306 shares homologies with serine/threonine phosphatases. N1310 encodes RAP1 (TUF or SBF-E), a transcription regulator. N1330 is the MER1 gene required for chromosome pairing and genetic recombination. Two ORFs show no homology with proteins in the databases and no particular features. N1311 is not likely to be expressed as it is located on the complementary strand of N1310.
