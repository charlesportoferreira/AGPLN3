The C-terminal silencing domain of Rap1p is essential for the repression of ribosomal protein genes in response to a defect in the secretory pathway.

We have previously shown that a functional secretory pathway is essential for continued ribosome synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in the secretory pathway is transferred to the non-permissive temperature, transcription of both rRNA genes and ribosomal protein genes is nearly abolished. In order to define the cis -acting element(s) of ribosomal protein genes sensitive to a defect in the secretory pathway, we have constructed a series of fusion genes containing the CYH2 promoter region, with various deletions, fused to lacZ. Each fusion gene for which transcription is detected is subject to the repression. Rap1p is the transcriptional activator for most ribosomal protein genes, as well as having an important role in silencing in the vicinity of telomeres and at the silent mating-type loci. To assess its role in the repression of transcription by the defect in the secretory pathway, we have introduced rap1 mutations. The replacement of wild-type Rap1p by Rap1p truncated at the C-terminal region caused substantial attenuation of the repression. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the Rap1p-truncation affects the repression of TCM1 , encoding ribosomal protein L3, which has no Rap1p-binding site in its upstream regulatory region. These results suggest that the repression of transcription of ribosomal protein genes by a secretory defect is mediated through Rap1p, but does not require a Rap1p-binding site within the UAS.
