A multi-component upstream activation sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter.

The majority of the activation potential of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TDH3 gene promoter is contained within nucleotides -676 to -381 (relative to the translation initiation codon). An upstream activation sequence (UAS) in this region has been characterized by in vitro and in vivo assays and demonstrated to be composed of two small, adjacent DNA sequence elements. The essential determinant of this upstream UAS is a general regulatory factor 1 (GRF1) binding site at nucleotides -513 to -501. A synthetic DNA element comprising this sequence, or an analogue in which two of the degenerate nucleotides of the GRF1 site consensus sequence were altered, activated 5' deleted TDH3 and CYC1 promoters. The second DNA element of the UAS is a 7 bp sequence which is conserved in the promoters of several yeast genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and occurs at positions -486 to -480 of the TDH3 promoter. This DNA sequence represents a novel promoter element: it contains no UAS activity itself, yet potentiates the activity of a GRF1 UAS. The potentiation of the GRF1 UAS by this element occurs when placed upstream from the TATA box of either the TDH3 or CYC1 promoters. The characteristics of this element (termed GPE for GRF1 site potentiator element) indicate that it represents a binding site for a different yeast protein which increases the promoter activation mediated by the GRF1 protein. Site-specific deletion and promoter reconstruction experiments suggest that the entire activation potential of the -676 to -381 region of the TDH3 gene promoter may be accounted for by a combination of the GRF1 site and the GPE.
