The promoter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae FBA1 gene contains a single positive upstream regulatory element.

The glycolytic enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is encoded by the FBA1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of aldolase gene is not regulated by glucose and high levels of expression have been observed also during growth on nonfermentable carbon source. A FBA1::lacZ gene fusion was constructed and a deletion analysis demonstrated the presence of a unique cis-acting positive upstream element (UAS) required for high levels of FBA1 expression. This element is located between positions -550 and -440 upstream of the aldolase open reading frame and it contains sequences known to constitute the binding sites for the multifunctional proteins RAP1 and ABFI and two TTCC motifs.
