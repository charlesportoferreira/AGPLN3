Molecular analysis of the SNF8 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Mutations in the SNF8 gene impair derepression of the SUC2 gene, encoding invertase, in response to glucose limitation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We report here the cloning of the SNF8 gene by complementation. Sequence analysis predicts a 26,936-dalton product. Disruption of the chromosomal locus caused a five-fold decrease in invertase derepression, defective growth on raffinose, and a sporulation defect in homozygous diploids. Genetic analysis of the interactions of the snf8 null mutation with spt6/ssn20 and ssn6 suppressors distinguished SNF8 from the groups, SNF1, SNF4 and SNF2, SNF5, SNF6. Notably, the snf8 ssn6 double mutants were extremely sick. Mutations of SNF8 and SNF7 showed similar phenotypes and genetic interactions, and the double mutant combination caused no additional phenotypic impairment. These findings suggest that SNF7 and SNF8 are functionally related.
