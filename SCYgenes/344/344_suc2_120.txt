The secreted form of invertase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is synthesized from mRNA encoding a signal sequence.

The SUC2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two differently regulated mRNAs (1.8 and 1.9 kilobases) that differ at their 5' ends. The larger RNA encodes a secreted, glycosylated form of invertase and the smaller RNA encodes an intracellular, nonglycosylated form. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the amino-terminal coding region of the SUC2 gene and its upstream flanking region and have mapped the 5' ends of the SUC2 mRNAs relative to the DNA sequence. The 1.9-kilobase RNA contains a signal peptide coding sequence and presumably encodes a precursor to secreted invertase. The 1.8-kilobase RNA does not include the complete coding sequence for the signal peptide. The nucleotide sequence data prove that SUC2 is a structural gene for invertase, and translation of the coding information provides the complete amino acid sequence of an S. cerevisiae signal peptide.
