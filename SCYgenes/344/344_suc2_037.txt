Cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding invertase (INV1) from the yeast Candida utilis.

The gene INV1 encoding invertase from the yeast Candida utilis has been cloned using a homologous PCR hybridization probe, amplified with two sets of degenerate primers designed considering sequence comparisons between yeast invertases. The cloned gene was sequenced and found to encode a polypeptide of 533 amino acids that contain a 26 amino-acid signal peptide and 12 potential N-glycosylation sites. The nucleotide sequences of the 5' and 3' non-coding regions were found to contain motifs probably involved in initiation, regulation and termination of gene transcription. The amino-acid sequence shows significant identity with other yeast, bacterial and plant beta-fructofuranosidases. The INV1 gene from C. utilis was able to complement functionally the suc2 mutation of S. cerevisiae.
