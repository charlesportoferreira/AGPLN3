Carbon catabolite repression of invertase during batch cultivations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the role of glucose, fructose, and mannose.

When Saccharomyces cerevisiae are grown on a mixture of glucose and another fermentable sugar such as sucrose, maltose or galactose, the metabolism is diauxic, i.e. glucose is metabolized first, whereas the other sugars are metabolized when glucose is exhausted. This phenomenon is a consequence of glucose repression, or more generally, catabolite repression. Besides glucose, the hexoses fructose and mannose are generally also believed to trigger catabolite repression. In this study, batch fermentations of S. cerevisiae in mixtures of sucrose and either glucose, fructose or mannose were performed. It was found that the utilization of sucrose is inhibited by concentrations of either glucose or fructose higher than 5 g/l, and thus that glucose and fructose are equally capable of exerting catabolite repression. However, sucrose was found to be hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose, even when the mannose concentration was as high as 17 g/l, indicating, that mannose is not a repressing sugar. It is suggested that the capability to trigger catabolite repression is connected to hexokinase PII, which is involved in the in vivo phosphorylation of glucose and fructose.
