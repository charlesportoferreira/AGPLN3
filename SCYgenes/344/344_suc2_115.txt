Cytoplasmic and secreted Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase mRNAs encoded by one gene can be differentially or coordinately regulated.

A single structural gene, SUC2, encodes both secreted and cytoplasmic invertase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is known that the unprocessed polypeptides which differ by a secretion signal sequence are encoded by separate mRNAs. This unusual transcriptional organization raises the question as to the degree to which the transcripts can be independently regulated. To define a system for studying this problem, we examined invertase transcription after various physiological perturbations of cells: rapid catabolite derepression, heat shock, and cell cycle arrest. With each treatment, fluctuations in mRNA levels for both cytoplasmic and secreted invertase were observed. We concluded that (i) catabolite-derepressed synthesis of the mRNAs occurs rapidly after a drop in glucose, is a sustained response, and does not require de novo protein synthesis; (ii) heat shock transcription of both invertase mRNAs is, in contrast, a brief and transient response requiring de novo protein synthesis; and (iii) alpha-mating hormone treatment (G1 phase arrest and release) results in regular and coordinated synthesis of both mRNAs midway between rounds of histone mRNA synthesis. We propose that invertase mRNA regulation involves constitutively synthesized transcriptional factors (observed during catabolite derepression) and transient factors (observed during heat shock and possibly during synchronous growth). Moreover, the mRNA levels for secreted and cytoplasmic invertase can be independently regulated.
