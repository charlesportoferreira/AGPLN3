Saccharomyces cerevisiae BUR6 encodes a DRAP1/NC2alpha homolog that has both positive and negative roles in transcription in vivo.

BUR3 and BUR6 were identified previously by selecting for mutations that increase transcription from an upstream activating sequence (UAS)-less promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The bur3-1 and bur6-1 mutations are recessive, increase transcription from a suc2 delta uas allele, and cause other mutant phenotypes, suggesting that Bur3p and Bur6p function as general repressors of the basal transcriptional machinery. The molecular cloning and characterization of BUR3 and BUR6 are presented here. BUR3 is identical to MOT1, a previously characterized essential gene that encodes an ATP-dependent inhibitor of the TATA box-binding protein. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that BUR6 encodes a homolog of DRAP1 (also called NC2alpha), a mammalian repressor of basal transcription. Strains that contain a bur6 null allele are viable but grow extremely poorly, demonstrating that BUR6 is critical for normal cell growth in yeast. The Bur6p histone fold domain is required for function; an extensive nonoverlapping set of deletion alleles throughout the histone fold domain impairs BUR6 function in vivo, whereas mutations in the amino- and carboxy-terminal tails have no detectable effect. BUR6 and BUR3/MOT1 have different functions depending on promoter context: although the bur3-1 and bur6-1 mutations increase transcription from delta uas promoters, they result in reduced transcription from the wild-type GAL1 and GAL10 promoters. This transcriptional defect is due to the inability of the GAL10 UAS to function in bur6-1 strains. The similar phenotypes of bur6 and bur3 (mot1) mutations suggest that Bur6p and Mot1p have related, but not identical, functions in modulating the activity of the general transcription machinery in vivo.
