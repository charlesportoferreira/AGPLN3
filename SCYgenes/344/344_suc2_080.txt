Characterization of TUP1, a mediator of glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The TUP1 and CYC8 (= SSN6) genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae play a major role in glucose repression. Mutations in either TUP1 or CYC8 eliminate or reduce glucose repression of many repressible genes and induce other phenotypes, including flocculence, failure to sporulate, and sterility of MAT alpha cells. The TUP1 gene was isolated in a screen for genes that regulate mating type (V.L. MacKay, Methods Enzymol. 101:325-343, 1983). We found that a 3.5-kb restriction fragment was sufficient for complete complementation of tup1-100. The gene was further localized by insertional mutagenesis and RNA mapping. Sequence analysis of 2.9 kb of DNA including TUP1 revealed only one long open reading frame which predicts a protein of molecular weight 78,221. The predicted protein is rich in serine, threonine, and glutamine. In the carboxyl region there are six repeats of a pattern of about 43 amino acids. This same pattern of conserved residues is seen in the beta subunit of transducin and the yeast CDC4 gene product. Insertion and deletion mutants are viable, with the same range of phenotypes as for point mutants. Deletions of the 3' end of the coding region produced the same mutant phenotypes as did total deletions, suggesting that the C terminus is critical for TUP1 function. Strains with deletions in both the CYC8 and TUP1 genes are viable, with phenotypes similar to those of strains with a single deletion. A deletion mutation of TUP1 was able to suppress the snf1 mutation block on expression of the SUC2 gene encoding invertase.
