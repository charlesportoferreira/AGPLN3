The SNF2, SNF5 and SNF6 genes are required for Ty transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF2, SNF5 and SNF6 genes were initially identified as genes required for expression of SUC2 and other glucose repressible genes. The Suc- defect in all three of these classes of mutants is suppressed by mutations in the SPT6 gene. Since mutations in SPT6 had also been identified as suppressors of Ty and solo delta insertion mutations at the HIS4 and LYS2 loci, we have examined Ty transcription in snf2, snf5 and snf6 mutants and have found that Ty transcription is abolished or greatly reduced. The snf2, snf5 and snf6 defect for Ty transcription, like the defect for SUC2 transcription, is suppressed by spt6 mutations. In contrast to other mutations that abolish or greatly reduce Ty transcription (in the SPT3, SPT7 and SPT8 genes), mutations in these SNF genes do not cause suppression of insertion mutations. This result suggests that the SNF2, SNF5 and SNF6 gene products act by a distinct mechanism from the SPT3, SPT7 and SPT8 gene products to promote transcription of Ty elements. This result also suggests that a reduction of Ty transcription is not always sufficient for activation of adjacent gene expression.
