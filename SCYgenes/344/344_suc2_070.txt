Chromatin structure of the yeast SUC2 promoter in regulatory mutants.

We have previously suggested that two positioned nucleosomes are removed from the promoter of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC2 gene upon depression by glucose starvation. To gain further insight into the changes accompanying derepression at the chromatin level we have studied the chromatin structure of the SUC2 promoter in several mutants affecting SUC2 expression. The non-derepressible mutants snf1, snf2 and snf5 present a chromatin structure characteristic of the repressed state, irrespective of the presence or absence of glucose. The non-repressible mutants, mig1 and ssn6, as well as the double mutant snfs sn6 exhibit an opened chromatin structure even in the presence of glucose. These results suggest that the DNA-binding protein encoded by MIG1 is necessary to produce the characteristic pattern of repressed chromatin and that the SNF1 protein kinase is sufficient to produce the derepressed chromatin pattern. A model is presented for the transitions that result in opening up of the chromatin structure.
