The trans action of HMRa in mating type interconversion.

HML and HMR are the sites of cryptic mating type genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the presence of the HO gene, the information from HML or HMR (an a or alpha cassette) is transferred to the mating type locus (MAT). HML, HMR, and MAT are located on chromosome III, yet are widely separated. Similarly, in other yeasts, at least some of the genes involved in mating typing interconversion are linked to the mating type locus. We demonstrate here that a cassette donor (HMR) and the cassette target (MAT) need not be physically linked for successful mating type interconversion. In particular, we show that HMRa on one chromosome can donate an a cassette to the mating type locus on a homologous chromosome III.
