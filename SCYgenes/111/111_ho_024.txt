Diversity of the HO gene encoding an endonuclease for mating-type conversion in the bottom fermenting yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus.

Two types of HO gene were cloned, sequenced and characterized from the bottom fermenting yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus. The HO gene present on the 1500 kb chromosome was designated Sc-HO (S. cerevisiae-type HO), because the nucleotide sequence of its promoter region and the open reading frame (ORF) was almost identical to that of the S. cerevisiae laboratory strain HO gene (Lab-HO). The other HO gene, designated Lg-HO (Lager-fermenting-yeast specific HO), showed 64% and 83% homology with the promoter and ORF of the Lab-HO at the nucleotide sequence level, respectively, and was located on the 1100 kb chromosome. Analysis of the 4 kb DNA fragment amplified from S. bayanus type strain indicated that the nucleotide sequence of S. bayanus-HO is almost identical to that of the Lg-HO. The SSB1 gene located downstream of the HO gene in S. cerevisiae was also found in the 3' distal region of the Sc-HO, Lg-HO and S. bayanus HO genes. These results showed that the genetic arrangement around the HO loci both of S. pastorianus and S. bayanus is identical to S. cerevisiae. Southern analysis has revealed that Saccharomyces sensu stricto contain four types of HO genes; S. paradoxus-type HO, the Sc-HO, the Lg-HO and S. uvarum-type HO genes. This HO gene diversity provides useful information for the classification of strains belonging to Saccharomyces sensu stricto. The S. pastorianus Sc-HO, Lg-HO and S. bayanus-HO Accession Nos in the DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Database are AB027449, AB027450 and AB027451, respectively. Copyright 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.
