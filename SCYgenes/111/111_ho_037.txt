Coordination of the initiation of recombination and the reductional division in meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Early exchange (EE) genes are required for the initiation of meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells with mutations in several EE genes undergo an earlier reductional division (MI), which suggests that the initiation of meiotic recombination is involved in determining proper timing of the division. The different effects of null mutations on the timing of reductional division allow EE genes to be assorted into three classes: mutations in RAD50 or REC102 that confer a very early reductional division; mutations in REC104 or REC114 that confer a division earlier than that of wild-type (WT) cells, but later than that of mutants of the first class; and mutations in MEI4 that do not significantly alter the timing of MI. The very early mutations are epistatic to mutations in the other two classes. We propose a model that accounts for the epistatic relationships and the communication between recombination initiation and the first division. Data in this article indicate that double-strand breaks (DSBs) are not the signal for the normal delay of reductional division; these experiments also confirm that MEI4 is required for the formation of meiotic DSBs. Finally, if a DSB is provided by the HO endonuclease, recombination can occur in the absence of MEI4 and REC104.
