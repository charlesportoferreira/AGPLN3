Mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC1 gene affect double-strand-break-induced intrachromosomal recombination.

To isolate Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective in recombinational DNA repair, we constructed a strain that contains duplicated ura3 alleles that flank LEU2 and ADE5 genes at the ura3 locus on chromosome V. When a HO endonuclease cleavage site is located within one of the ura3 alleles, Ura+ recombination is increased over 100-fold in wild-type strains following HO induction from the GAL1, 10 promoter. This strain was used to screen for mutants that exhibited reduced levels of HO-induced intrachromosomal recombination without significantly affecting the spontaneous frequency of Ura+ recombination. One of the mutations isolated through this screen was found to affect the essential gene CDC1. This mutation, cdc1-100, completely eliminated HO-induced Ura+ recombination yet maintained both spontaneous preinduced recombination levels and cell viability, cdc1-100 mutants were moderately sensitive to killing by methyl methanesulfonate and gamma irradiation. The effect of the cdc1-100 mutation on recombinational double-strand break repair indicates that a recombinationally silent mechanism other than sister chromatid exchange was responsible for the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks.
