Identification of new mediator subunits in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Mediator was isolated from yeast on the basis of its requirement for transcriptional activation in a fully defined system. We have now identified three new members of mediator in the low molecular mass range by peptide sequence determination. These are the products of the NUT2, CSE2, and MED11 genes. The product of the NUT1 gene is evidently a component of mediator as well. NUT1 and NUT2 were earlier identified as negative regulators of the HO promoter, whereas mutations in CSE2 affect chromosome segregation. MED11 is a previously uncharacterized gene. The existence of these proteins in the mediator complex was verified by copurification and co-immunoprecipitation with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme.
