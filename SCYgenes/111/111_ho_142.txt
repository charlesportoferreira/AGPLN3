A unique pathway of double-strand break repair operates in tandemly repeated genes.

The RAD52 gene product of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for most spontaneous recombination and almost all double-strand break (DSB) repair. In contrast to recombination elsewhere in the genome, recombination in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array is RAD52 independent. To determine the fate of a DSB in the rDNA gene array, a cut site for the HO endonuclease was inserted into the rDNA in a strain containing an inducible HO gene. DSBs were efficiently repaired at this site, even in the absence of the RAD52 gene product. Efficient RAD52-independent DSB repair was also observed at another tandem gene array, CUP1, consisting of 18 repeat units. However, in a smaller CUP1 array, consisting of only three units, most DSBs (ca. 80%) were not repaired and resulted in cell death. All RAD52-independent DSB repair events examined resulted in the loss of one or more repeat units. We propose a model for DSB repair in repeated sequences involving the generation of single-stranded tails followed by reannealing.
