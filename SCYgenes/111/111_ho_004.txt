Isolation and characterization of the HO gene from the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus.

A DNA fragment homologous to the homothallism (HO) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated from Saccharomyces paradoxus and was found to contain an open reading frame that was 90.9% identical to the coding sequence of the S. cerevisiae HO gene. The putative HO gene was shown to induce diploidization in a heterothallic haploid strain from S. cerevisiae. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the coding and 5'-upstream regulatory regions from five Saccharomyces sensu stricto HO genes have coevolved, and that S. paradoxus is phylogenetically closer to S. cerevisiae than to S. bayanus. Finally, heterothallic haploid strains were isolated from the original homothallic type strain of S. paradoxus by disrupting the S. paradoxus HO gene with the S. cerevisiae URA3 gene.
