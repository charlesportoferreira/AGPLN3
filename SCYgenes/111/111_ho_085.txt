Association of yeast SIN1 with the tetratrico peptide repeats of CDC23.

The yeast SIN1 protein is a nuclear protein that together with other proteins behaves as a transcriptional repressor of a family of genes. In addition, sin1 mutants are defective in proper mitotic chromosome segregation. In an effort to understand the basis for these phenotypes, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with SIN1 in vivo. Here we demonstrate that CDC23, a protein known to be involved in sister chromatid separation during mitosis, is able to directly interact with SIN1. Furthermore, using recombinant molecules in vitro, we show that the N terminal of SIN1 is sufficient to bind a portion of CDC23 consisting solely of tetratrico peptide repeats. Earlier experiments identified the C-terminal domain of SIN1 to be responsible for interaction with a protein that binds the regulatory region of HO, a gene whose transcription is repressed by SIN1. Taken together with the results presented here, we suggest that SIN1 is a chromatin protein having at least a dual function: The N terminal of SIN1 interacts with the tetratrico peptide repeat domains of CDC23, a protein involved in chromosome segregation, whereas the C terminal of SIN1 binds proteins involved in transcriptional regulation.
