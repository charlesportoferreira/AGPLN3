Double-strand breaks stimulate alternative mechanisms of recombination repair.

To test the double-strand break repair model, we used HO nuclease to introduce double-strand breaks at several sites along a yeast chromosome containing duplicated DNA. Depending on the configuration of the double-strand break and recombining markers, different spectra of recombinant products were observed. Different repair kinetics and recombinant products were observed when a double-strand break was introduced in unique or duplicated DNA. The results of this study suggest that double-strand breaks in yeast stimulate recombination by several mechanisms, and we propose an alternative mechanism for double-strand break-induced gene conversion that does not depend on direct participation of the broken ends.
