Branch migration during Rad51-promoted strand exchange proceeds in either direction.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 protein is important for genetic recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks in vivo and can promote strand exchange between linear double-stranded DNA and circular single-stranded DNA in vitro. However, unlike Escherichia coli RecA, Rad51 requires an overhanging complementary 3' or 5' end to initiate strand exchange; given that fact, we previously surmised that the fully exchanged molecules resulted from branch migration in either direction depending on which type of end initiated the joint molecule. Our present experiments confirm that branch migration proceeds in either direction, the polarity depending on whether a 3' or 5' end initiates the joint molecules. Furthermore, heteroduplex DNA is formed rapidly, first at the overhanging end of the linear double-stranded DNA's complementary strand and then more slowly by progressive lengthening of the heteroduplex region until strand exchange is complete. Although joint molecule formation occurs equally efficiently when initiated with a 3' or 5' overhanging end, branch migration proceeds more rapidly when it is initiated by an overhanging 3' end, i.e., in the 5' to 3' direction with respect to the single-stranded DNA.
