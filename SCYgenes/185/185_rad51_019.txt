Investigation of the stability of yeast rad52 mutant proteins uncovers post-translational and transcriptional regulation of Rad52p.

We investigated the stability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52 protein to learn how a cell controls its quantity and longevity. We measured the cellular levels of wild-type and mutant forms of Rad52p when expressed from the RAD52 promoter and the half-lives of the various forms of Rad52p when expressed from the GAL1 promoter. The wild-type protein has a half-life of 15 min. rad52 mutations variably affect the cellular levels of the protein products, and these levels correlate with the measured half-lives. While missense mutations in the N terminus of the protein drastically reduce the cellular levels of the mutant proteins, two mutations--one a deletion of amino acids 210-327 and the other a missense mutation of residue 235--increase the cellular level and half-life more than twofold. These results suggest that Rad52p is subject to post-translational regulation. Proteasomal mutations have no effect on Rad52p half-life but increase the amount of RAD52 message. In contrast to Rad52p, the half-life of Rad51p is &gt;2 hr, and RAD51 expression is unaffected by proteasomal mutations. These differences between Rad52p and Rad51p suggest differential regulation of two proteins that interact in recombinational repair.
