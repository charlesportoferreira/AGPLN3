The Rad51 pathway of telomerase-independent maintenance of telomeres can amplify TG1-3 sequences in yku and cdc13 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc13, Yku, and telomerase define three parallel pathways for telomere end protection that prevent chromosome instability and death by senescence. We report here that cdc13-1 yku70delta mutants generated telomere deprotection-resistant cells that, in contrast with telomerase-negative senescent cells, did not display classical crisis events. cdc13-1 yku70delta cells survived telomere deprotection by exclusively amplifying TG(1-3) repeats (type II recombination). In a background lacking telomerase (tlc1delta), this process predominated over type I recombination (amplification of subtelomeric Y' sequences). Strikingly, inactivation of the Rad50/Rad59 pathway (which is normally required for type II recombination) in cdc13-1 yku70delta or yku70delta tlc1delta mutants, but also in cdc13-1 YKU70(+) tlc1delta mutants, still permitted type II recombination, but this process was now entirely dependent on the Rad51 pathway. In addition, delayed senescence was observed in cdc13-1 yku70delta rad51delta and cdc13-1 tlc1delta rad51delta cells. These results demonstrate that in wild-type cells, masking by Cdc13 and Yku prevents the Rad51 pathway from amplifying telomeric TG(1-3) sequences. They also suggest that Rad51 is more efficient than Rad50 in amplifying the sequences left uncovered by the absence of Cdc13 or Yku70.
