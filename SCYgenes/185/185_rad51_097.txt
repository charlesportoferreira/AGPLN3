Zip3 provides a link between recombination enzymes and synaptonemal complex proteins.

In budding yeast, absence of the meiosis-specific Zip3 protein (also known as Cst9) causes synaptonemal complex formation to be delayed and incomplete. The Zip3 protein colocalizes with Zip2 at discrete foci on meiotic chromosomes, corresponding to the sites where synapsis initiates. Observations suggest that Zip3 promotes synapsis by recruiting the Zip2 protein to chromosomes and/or stabilizing the association of Zip2 with chromosomes. Zip3 interacts with a number of gene products involved in meiotic recombination, including proteins that act at both early (Mre11, Rad51, and Rad57) and late (Msh4 and Msh5) steps in the exchange process. We speculate that Zip3 is a component of recombination nodules and serves to link the initiation of synapsis to meiotic recombination.
