Homologous chromosome associations and nuclear order in meiotic and mitotically dividing cells of budding yeast.

This chapter discusses the relationship between nuclear order and the association of homologous DNA sequences in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Homologous chromosomes functionally interact with one another to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced either environmentally (e.g., by gamma-irradiation) or deliberately by the cell (e. g., during meiosis). DNA homology recognition in these instances often involves the (RecA) homolog RAD51 and/or the related gene, DMC1. Evidence for interactions between homologous chromosomes occurring independent of DSB formation and (RecA) homolog function has also been described in meiotic, premeiotic, and mitotically dividing cells of yeast. These interactions presumably depend upon DNA homology but the molecular details of such associations are poorly understood. Both DSB-dependent and -independent homolog associations may be facilitated by the nonrandom organization of chromosomes in the nucleus, including centromere and telomere clustering, which are also discussed.
