Genetic requirements for the targeted integration of Agrobacterium T-DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens delivers transferred DNA (T-DNA) into cells of plants and yeast. In plants, the T-DNA integrates at random positions into the genome by non-homologous recombination (NHR), whereas in yeast the T-DNA preferably integrates by homologous recombination (HR). Here we show that T-DNA integration by HR in yeast requires the recombination/repair proteins Rad51 and Rad52, but not Rad50, Mre11, Xrs2, Yku70 and Lig4. In the HR events a remarkable shift from insertion-type events to replacement events was observed in rad50, mre11 and xrs2 mutants. Residual integration in the rad51 mutant occurred predominantly by HR, whereas in the rad52 mutant integration occurred exclusively by NHR. Previously, we found that T-DNA integration by NHR is abolished in a yku70 mutant. Thus, Rad52 and Yku70 are the key regulators of T-DNA integration, channeling integration into either the HR or NHR pathway.
