Activation of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by addition of hydrogen peroxide.

Addition of hydrogen peroxide (greater than 10 mM) to aerated derepressed cells of S. cerevisiae in the absence of substrate caused a boost of endogenous respiration and both intra- and extracellular acidification, without any significant change in cellular ATP level. Furthermore, a hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane was indicated by an enhanced accumulation of tetraphenylphosphonium in the cells. The extracellular pH attained was as low as 3.5. The acidification could be suspended by the H(+)-ATPase inhibitors diethylstilbestrol and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and was, in general, associated with an opposite flux of K+. K+ also stimulated the H(+)-ATPase activity in the purified plasma membrane fraction. These results are consistent with the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase being involved in the H+ extrusion induced by H2O2 in the absence of substrate. Extended exposure of cells to H2O2 led eventually to an arrest of both respiration and ion fluxes that could be again lifted by depolarizing the plasma membrane. Along with differences in the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio and in the participation of organic acids, this makes the H2O2-induced acidification distinct from that induced by glucose.
