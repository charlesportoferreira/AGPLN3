Physical, transcriptional and genetical mapping of a 24 kb DNA fragment located between the PMA1 and ATE1 loci on chromosome VII from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

A physical map of a contiguous DNA fragment of 60 kb, extending from the centromere to TRP5 on the left arm of the chromosome VII of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain IL125-2B, was established. Within a 31 kb region from PMA1 towards TRP5, a total of 12 transcription products ranging from 0.6 to 3.6 kb were identified in cells grown exponentially on rich medium. Near 87% of the DNA investigated was transcribed and on average one transcript, of 2.3 kb average length, was detected every 2.7 kb of DNA. The physical and genetical distances between the markers CEN7, pma1, leu1, pdr1 and trp5 were compared. A recombination frequency of 1 cM corresponds to an average distance of 3.3 kb between alleles in this region of chromosome VII.
