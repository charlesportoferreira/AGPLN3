Pleiotropic plasma membrane ATPase mutations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

We isolated a large number of mutations in the structural gene for the plasma membrane ATPase (PMA1) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These mutations were selected by their resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic hygromycin B. Biochemical analysis of purified membrane preparations showed that the plasma membrane ATPase activity of the mutants was reduced as much as 75%. Intragenic complementation of pma1 mutants suggested that the yeast plasma membrane ATPase was a multimeric enzyme. The pma1 mutants were apparently defective in maintaining internal pH; more than half of the mutants were unable to grow either at a low pH or in the presence of a weak acid. Most pma1 mutants were also osmotic pressure sensitive. At a very low temperature (5 degrees C) many pma1 mutants were unable to grow and were arrested as unbudded cells. The three most severely affected mutants were also unable to grow in the presence of NH4+. The most extreme mutant exhibited a severe defect in progression through the cell cycle; on synthetic medium, the cells progressively accumulated nucleus-containing small buds that generally failed to complete bud enlargement and cytokinesis. Most of the pleiotropic phenotypes of pma1 mutants could be suppressed by the addition of 50 mM KCl but not NaCl to the medium.
