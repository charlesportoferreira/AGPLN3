Cyclic AMP controls the plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The thermosensitive G1-arrested cdc35-10 mutant from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, defective in adenylate cyclase activity, was shifted to restrictive temperature. After 1 h incubation at this temperature, the plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity of cdc35-10 was reduced to 50%, whereas that in mitochondria doubled. Similar data were obtained with cdc25, another thermosensitive G1-arrested mutant modified in the cAMP pathway. In contrast, the ATPase activities of the G1-arrested mutant cdc19, defective in pyruvate kinase, were not affected after 2 h incubation at restrictive temperature. In the double mutants cdc35-10 cas1 and cdc25 cas1, addition of extracellular cAMP prevented the modifications of ATPase activities observed in the single mutants cdc35-10 and cdc25. These data indicate that cAMP acts as a positive effector on the H+-ATPase activity of plasma membranes and as a negative effector on that of mitochondria.
