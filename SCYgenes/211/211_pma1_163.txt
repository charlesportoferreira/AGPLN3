Genetic and molecular mapping of the pma1 mutation conferring vanadate resistance to the plasma membrane ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pma1 mutations confers vanadate-resistance to H+-ATPase activity when measured in isolated plasma membranes. In vivo, the growth of pma1 mutants is resistant to Dio-9, ethidium bromide and guanidine derivatives. This phenotype was used to map the pma1 mutation adjacent to LEU1 gene on chromosome VII. From a cosmid library of a wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, a large 30 kb DNA fragment was isolated by complementation of a leu1-pma1 double mutant. A 5kb HindIII fragment was subcloned and it restored both Leu+ and Pma+ phenotypes after integrative transformation. The restriction map of the 5 kb HindIII fragment and Southern blot analysis reveal that the cloned fragment contains the entire structural gene for the plasma membrane ATPase and the 5' end of the adjacent LEU1 gene. The pma1 mutation conferring vanadate-resistance is thus located in the structural gene for the plasma membrane ATPase.
