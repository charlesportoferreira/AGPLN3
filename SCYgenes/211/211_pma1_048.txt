Characterization of non-dominant lethal mutations in the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase gene.

Site-directed mutants of yeast ATPase were previously studied after introduction of mutant alleles into a yeast strain where these alleles were constitutively expressed while the expression of the wild-type chromosomal ATPase gene was turned off. As a functional H+ pump is essential, strong selective pressure leads to the accumulation of revertants during growth of cells harboring variants with low activity. Thus, constitutive expression of the mutant gene can select phenotypes which reflect events such as gene conversion or reversion. We have therefore re-evaluated the phenotypes of non-dominant lethal alleles in an alternative set of conditional expression systems. We show that eight of 11 previously described site-directed mutations behave as recessive lethal alleles.
