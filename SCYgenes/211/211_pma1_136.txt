The plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase from yeast. Effects of pH, vanadate and erythrosine B on ATP hydrolysis and ATP binding.

The H(+)-ATPase from the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated and purified. The rate of ATP hydrolysis and ATP binding was measured as a function of pH and the effect of the vanadate and erythrosine B inhibitors was investigated. The pH dependence of the rate of ATP hydrolysis forms a bell-shaped curve with a maximum at pH 6 and half-maximal rates at pH 5.0 and 7.4. Only the pH dependence between pH 6 and pH 7.6 is reversible. Above pH 7.6 and below pH 5.5, denaturation of the isolated enzyme is observed. The rate of ATP binding shows the same pH dependency as that of ATP hydrolysis. Both pH dependencies can be described by the dissociation of a monovalent acidic group with a pK of 7.4. It is concluded that the enzyme must be protonated before ATP binding. Vanadate does not inhibit ATP binding, ADP release or Pi release at concentrations where complete inhibition of ATP hydrolysis is observed. It is concluded that vanadate inhibits a step of the reaction cycle which occurs after Pi release. In contrast, erythrosine B inhibits ATP binding and thus affects the first step of the reaction cycle.
