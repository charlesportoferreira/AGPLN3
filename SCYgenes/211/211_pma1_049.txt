The two major types of plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases show different enzymatic properties and confer differential pH sensitivity of yeast growth.

The proton-pumping ATPase (H+-ATPase) of the plant plasma membrane is encoded by two major gene subfamilies. To characterize individual H+-ATPases, PMA2, an H+-ATPase isoform of tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia), was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found to functionally replace the yeast H+-ATPase if the external pH was kept above 5.0 (A. de Kerchove d'Exaerde, P. Supply, J.P. Dufour, P. Bogaerts, D. Thines, A. Goffeau, M. Boutry [1995] J Biol Chem 270: 23828-23837). In the present study we replaced the yeast H+-ATPase with PMA4, an H+-ATPase isoform from the second subfamily. Yeast expressing PMA4 grew at a pH as low as 4.0. This was correlated with a higher acidification of the external medium and an approximately 50% increase of ATPase activity compared with PMA2. Although both PMA2 and PMA4 had a similar pH optimum (6.6-6.8), the profile was different on the alkaline side. At pH 7.2 PMA2 kept more than 80% of the maximal activity, whereas that of PMA4 decreased to less than 40%. Both enzymes were stimulated up to 3-fold by 100 microgram/mL lysophosphatidylcholine, but this stimulation vanished at a higher concentration in PMA4. These data demonstrate functional differences between two plant H+-ATPases expressed in the same heterologous host. Characterization of two PMA4 mutants selected to allow yeast growth at pH 3.0 revealed that mutations within the carboxy-terminal region of PMA4 could still improve the enzyme, resulting in better growth of yeast cells.
