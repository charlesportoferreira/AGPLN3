structur and function of cyclin depend kinas of saccharomyc | yeast saccharomyc ha five cyclin depend protein kinas | cdk | cdc | srb | kin | ctk | and | ani of these cdk requir cyclin partner for it kinas activ and cdk | cyclin complex | thu | phosphoryl of specif substrat protein to exert it function | the cyclin partner of srb | kin | and ctk ar srb | ccl | and ctk | respect | in contrast to the fact that each of srb | kin | and ctk ha singl cyclin partner | cdc and ar polygamou | cdc ha cyclin and ha cyclin | among these cdk | kin and cdc ar essenti cdk and it is well known that cdc kinas plai major role in regul cell cycle progress | is non essenti cdk but it absenc caus broad spectrum of phenotyp such as constitut express of | inabl to util non ferment carbon sourc | defect in cell cycle progress | and so on | homologu ar expand to higher eukaryot | is most close with cdk in term of the amino acid sequenc | the function analysi of the domain of also support the close relationship between and cdk | in which it shown that the method of regul of these two kinas is similar | furthermor | express of the mammalian cdk gene in phodelta strain cancel part of the defect | in thi review | we summar the function of both | cyclin kinas and emphas yeast as valuabl model system to elucid the function of their homologu in other organ |
