saccharomyc promot region | locat and function of the upstream activ site | saccharomyc repress acid phosphatas | is when inorgan phosphat in the cultur medium is deplet | to studi the mechan of thi regul | we variou delet in the | flank region of the gene | two element by thi analysi | an upstream activ site | ua | and downstream element | both plai part in the express of thi gene | the ua is between and upstream of the initi codon and activ express of the gene when inorgan phosphat is deplet | it consist of two region | ua i and ua ii | that contain ctgcacaaatg and an adenin plu thymine rich sequenc | either on of which suffic for the effect | the downstream element includ put tata box at from the atg codon and is necessari for effici transcript and express of the normal size transcript | the distanc between the ua and the downstream element can be without caus loss of express effici | and the action of the ua is not by it orient | these result ar consist with model wherein ua act as site of activ for transcript by interact with protein factor | that becom activ when inorgan phosphat is deplet from the cultur medium |
