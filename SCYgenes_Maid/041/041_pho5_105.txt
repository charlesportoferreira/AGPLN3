the yeast phosphatas system | yeast cell produc of enzyme which ar in the metabol of phosphat | and includ acid and alkalin phosphatas as well as permeas | most of these enzyme ar in respons to the presenc or absenc of inorgan phosphat | in the past few year consider amount of genet and molecular evid ha accumul and rather precis overal pictur emerg which describ the mechan of phosphat control at the level of gene activ | thi mini review summar these data | the main focu li on the regulatori featur associ with the control of transcript of | gene code for most of the acid phosphatas activ by yeast cell |
