the transactiv domain of is for nucleosom disrupt at the promot | the chromatin structur of the promot is when the promot is by phosphat starvat | the transactiv | is primarili respons for thi chang | we have delet of in order to determin which protein domain ar in nucleosom dissolut | our result show that the dna bind domain by itself is not suffici to trigger chromatin disrupt | even when | in vivo footprint reveal that deriv lack the n termin activ domain can bind to uasp | which resid in constitut nucleosom free region | but not to uasp | which li within nucleosom in the promot | the acid activ domain of appear to be in nucleosom disrupt | substitut of the nativ transactiv domain of with that from vp result in substanti chromatin disrupt | in everi case | the abil of the mutant to activ transcript correl with their abil to disrupt nucleosom structur in the promot | therefor | we conclud that the activ domain ha at least two role | i | to trigger disrupt of nucleosom structur over the promot | therebi facilit the bind of transcript factor | and | ii | to interact with the transcript apparatu at the proxim promot |
