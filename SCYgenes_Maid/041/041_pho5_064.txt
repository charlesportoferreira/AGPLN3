yeast histon h and h n termini function through differ gal regulatori element to repress and activ transcript | previou work ha shown that n termin delet of yeast histon h caus to fold increas in the induct of gal and number of other gene in galactos metabol | in contrast | delet at the h n terminu caus to fold decreas in the induct of these same gal gene | howev | h and h n termin delet each decreas induct onli to fold | to defin the gal gene regulatori element through which the histon n termini activ or repress transcript | fusion between gal and promot element attach to beta galactosidas report gene | we show here that gal hyperactivation by the h n termin delet delta is to the upstream activ sequenc | convers | the rel decreas in gal induct by the hn termin delet delta is to the downstream promot which contain the tata element | these data indic that the h n terminu is for the repress of the gal upstream element | wherea the hn terminu is for the activ of the gal downstream promot element |
