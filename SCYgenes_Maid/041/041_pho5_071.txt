nucleosom preclud bind of the transcript factor in vivo to critic target site in the promot | activ of the saccharomyc gene by phosphat starvat is accompani by the disappear of two pair of nucleosom that short region in the promot | the transcript factor is the kei regul of thi transit | by in vitro footprint it previous shown that there is low affin site | uasp | which is in the short region in the inact promot | and high affin site | uasp | which is in the adjac nucleosom | to investig the interplai between nucleosom and | we have in vivo footprint experi with dimethylsulf | to bind to both site in the activ promot | in contrast | it bind to neither site in the promot | lack of bind under repress condit is larg due to the low affin of for it bind site under these condit | despit the affin of for it target site under activ condit | bind to uasp is by the presenc of the nucleosom and can onli occur after prior disrupt of thi nucleosom in process that requir uasp | protect of the uasp by the nucleosom is not absolut | howev | sinc overexpress of can disrupt thi nucleosom even when uasp is | also under these condit | with onli uasp present | all four nucleosom at the promot ar | wherea no chromatin chang at all is when both ua element ar |
