global histon acetyl and deacetyl in yeast | histon acetyltransferas and deacetylas can be target to promot to activ or repress gene | for exampl | the histon acetyltransferas gcn is part of yeast multiprotein complex that is by the dna bind activ protein gcn | ref | the histon deacetylas rpd complex is to dna by the repressor um | ref | similar mechan exist in other eukaryot | howev | delet of rpd also increas express of the gene that is by nucleosom | and by gcn | ref | but not by um | we have whether acetyl and deacetyl ar promot specif at | by us antibodi against acetyl lysine residu and chromatin immunoprecipit to examin the acetyl state of | kilobas region surround the gene | here we show that thi region is acetyl extens by esa and gcn and deacetyl by hda and rpd | and that widespread histon modif affect three separ chromosom region | which total kb | our data indic that target modif occur in background of global acetyl and deacetyl that not onli reduc basal transcript | but also allow rapid return to the initi state of acetyl when target is |
