histon ar first hyperacetylate and then lose contact with the promot | we have the histon modif statu of the promot from yeast by the chip technolog and have on chang occur upon activ | us variou acetyl specif antibodi | we dramat loss of the acetyl signal upon induct of the promot | thi out to be due | howev | to the progress loss of histon altogeth | the fulli promot appear to be devoid of histon as judg by chip analys | local histon hyperacetylation doe inde occur | howev | prior to remodel | thi can explain the delai in chromatin remodel in the absenc of histon acetyltransferas activ of the saga complex that previous document for the promot | our find new light on the nucleosom structur of fulli chromatin | at the same time | thei point out the need for novel control when the chip techniqu is to studi histon modif in the context of chromatin remodel in vivo |
