imag and map protein bind site on dna regulatori region with atom forc microscopi | regul of gene express is fundament in biolog system | systematic search for protein bind site in gene promot ha been done in recent year | biochem techniqu ar easi and reliabl when analys protein interact with short piec of dna | but ar difficult and tediou when long piec of dna have to be analys | here we propos afm as reliabl and easi techniqu for identifi protein interact site in long dna molecul like gene promot | we support thi idea us well known model | the interact of the protein with the gene promot | we have also the techniqu to demonstr that mig protein bind to two motif in the promot of hxk gene | our result allow us to defin migp as new factor probabl contribut to the carbon sourc depend transcript regul of hxk gene | copyright academ press |
