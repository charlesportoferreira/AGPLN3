increas in gene express by respiratori defici mutat | respiratori defici mutant | rho cell | of saccharomyc about time as much human | h | lysozyme as wild type strain | rho | cell | when the gal promot in an express with the h lysozyme gene | introduct of intact mitochondria into the rho cell in signific decreas in the product of h lysozyme | indic that the rho mutat the express of the h lysozyme gene | the copi number of the express not respons for the express | the level of h lysozyme mrna in the rho cell also much higher than that in the rho | cell especi at the stationari phase | the express of the h lysozyme gene also when glyceraldehyde phosphat dehydrogenase gene promot and the promot in the express | the rho mutat also the express of the gene under the control of the hi promot in and the act gene in the yeast chromosom | but not increas the express of the ribosom rna gene | in contrast to the rho mutant | pet mutant not show higher gene express with wild type strain |
