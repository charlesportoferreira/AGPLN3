the plant protein | phytohemagglutinin | is transport to the vacuol of transgen yeast | phytohemagglutinin | pha | the major seed lectin of the common bean | phaseolu vulgari | accumul in the parenchyma cell of the cotyledon | it ha been previous shown that pha is cotranslation into the endoplasm reticulum with cleavag of the nh termin signal peptid | two n oligosaccharid side chain ar | on of which is modifi to complex type in the golgi apparatu | pha is then deposit in membran protein storag vacuol which ar biochem and function equival to the vacuol of yeast cell and the lysosome of anim cell | we to determin whether yeast cell would recogn the sort determin of pha and target the protein to the yeast vacuol | we have the gene for leukoagglutin pha | pha l | in yeast under control of the yeast acid phosphatas | promot | under control of thi promot | pha l accumul to | of the total yeast protein | pha l in yeast is as expect for yeast glycoprotein | cell fraction studi show that pha l is effici transport to the yeast vacuol | thi is the first demonstr that target inform is between two highli diverg speci | small proport of yeast pha l is which mai be due to ineffici recognit of the sort signal becaus of the presenc of an uncleav signal peptid on subset of the pha l polypeptide | thi system can now be to identifi the sort determin of plant protein |
