the yeast hpr gene ha function role in transcript elong that uncov novel sourc of genom instabl | the yeast hpr gene plai an import role in genom stabil | as by the observ that hpr mutant have high frequenc of dna repeat recombin and chromosom loss | here we report that hpr is for transcript elong | transcript driven from constitut and yeast promot cannot elong through the bacteri lacz code region in hprdelta cell | but progress effici through other sequenc such as yeast | we show that hpr is not for transcript activ and that the previous effect of hprdelta on the activ of differ promot is consequ of the incapac of hprdelta cell to elong transcript through lacz | as report | transcript defect ar also in yeast dna sequenc of hprdelta cell in the presenc of the transcript elong inhibitor azauracil | in all case | the blockag of transcript elong in hprdelta is associ with both the high frequenc of delet and the increas in instabl that we report here | therefor | in addit to the identif of new element in transcript elong | our work provid evid for new sourc of genom instabl |
