seri of shuttl vector us chloramphenicol acetyltransferas as report in yeast | report from numer laboratori have shown that the gene code for the bacteri chloramphenicol o acetyltransferas can be as report gene | cat | in mammalian and plant system to analyz gene activ at the transcript level when combin with endogen regulatori signal | the activ can be quantifi by chromatograph or photometr assai | to adapt thi simpl and highli sensit test for the yeast system | we seri of yeast vector contain the cat gene togeth with select marker for escherichia coli and yeast | integr | autonom replic and centromer carri plasmid | we show that the cat gene lack the endogen promot is at low level in yeast transform | to demonstr function express of the cat gene under the control of yeast promot | we the regulatori region | we that cat express via the promot in manner as for the endogen gene | wherea in the state cat express low | us these vector | it should be feasibl to analyz other sequenc confer promot activ or other control function in yeast |
