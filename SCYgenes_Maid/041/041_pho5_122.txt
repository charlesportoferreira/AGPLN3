synthesi of glia nexin in yeast | glia nexin | gdn | is kda glycoprotein from rat glioma cell cultur | it promot neurit extens in cultur of neuroblastoma cell and chick sympathetic neuron | moreov | gdn is potent serin proteas inhibitor | serpin | belong to the famili of proteas nexin | we report here the express of rat gdn in the saccharomyc strain grf under the control of the promot | we describ the purif of more than mg total gdn from the cellular extract of liter of yeast cultur | the amino acid composit and the sequenc of cnbr fragment of the recombin protein correl with the valu from the rat gdn cdna | we provid evid that the recombin gdn ha exactli the same properti as the glioma protein with respect to it proteas inhibitori activ and it abil to promot the extens of neurit from neuroblastoma cell | the larg amount of recombin protein from thi express system will allow further biochem and physiological analysi of gdn and of the serpin in gener |
