the phosphatas system in saccharomyc | the yeast saccharomyc ha at least six speci of acid and alkalin phosphatas with differ cellular local | as well as inorgan phosphat | pi | transport | most of the gene encod these enzyme ar coordin and depend on the pi concentr in the growth medium | the pi signal ar convei to these gene through regulatori circuit consist of of posit and neg regulatori protein | thi phosphatas system is interest as on of the best system for studi gene regul in | due to the simplic of phenotyp determin in genet analysi | with thi methodolog advantag | consider amount of genet and molecular evid in phosphatas regul have been accumul in the past twenti five year | thi articl summar the current progress of research into thi subject |
