cysteine in helixii of the bhlh domain is essenti for homodimer of the yeast transcript factor phop | the yeast transcript factor phop is for express of the phosphat repress acid phosphatas by the gene | function studi have shown that the molecul is compos of an n termin acid activ domain | central region which is necessari for interact with neg regulatori factor | the cyclin | and termin basic helix loop helix domain | which mediat dna bind and homodimer | in thi studi the homodimer domain map specif to helixii of thi region and cysteine within thi region is essenti for thi function | experi support the role of an intermolecular disulfid bond in stabil of homodimer | which is critic for dna bind |
