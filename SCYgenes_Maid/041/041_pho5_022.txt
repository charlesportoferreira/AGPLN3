redox regul of amp synthesi in yeast | role of the basp and basp transcript factor | express of yeast amp synthesi gene | ad gene | sever when cell grown under oxid stress condit | to get an insight into the molecular mechan of thi new transcript regul | the role of the basp and basp transcript factor | known to activ express of the ad gene | in vitro | dna bind of basp sensit to oxid | howev | thi sensit could not account for the regul of the ad gene becaus we | us ba vp chimera | that basp dna bind activ not sensit to oxid in vivo | consist | tripl cysteine mutant of basp | fulli resist to oxid in vitro | unabl to restor transcript of the ad gene under oxid condit | we then the possibl that basp could be the oxid stress respons factor | interestingli | transcript of the gene | which is depend on basp but not on basp | to be sever impair by oxid stress | nevertheless | basp cysteine free mutant not suffici to confer resist to oxid stress | final | we that basp basp fusion protein ad gene express under oxid condit | thu suggest that redox sensit of ad gene express could be due to an impair of basp | basp interact | thi hypothesi further substanti in two hybrid experi show that basp | basp interact is by oxid stress |
