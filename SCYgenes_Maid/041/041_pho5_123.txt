function of the regulatori gene for repress acid phosphatas synthesi in saccharomyc | express of the repress acid phosphatas | rapas | gene | of saccharomyc is by certain level of inorgan phosphat | pi | in the medium and is when the pi concentr is | the pi signal ar convei to by regulatori system consist of protein code for by the | and gene | we have that the transcript of is by pi through the regulatori system | increas the dosag of and by ligat each gene to yep give rise to | respect | consider and weak synthesi of rapas by cultiv of the transform in high pi medium | but in low pi medium | dosag of stimul the rapas synthesi significantli | wherea ha no effect | dosag of stimul rapas synthesi consider in low pi but not in high pi | coordin increas of cancel the dosag effect of | but not that of | coordin increas of and give rise to the same phenotyp as an dosag of alon | the level of the protein to be the limit factor of the rapas synthesi and the copi number of the gene not to be | these fact accord with the idea that the protein transmit the pi signal to the gene via the protein | wherea the protein doe not have direct function in the signal transmiss |
