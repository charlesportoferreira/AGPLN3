character of the gene for fructos | bisphosphatas from saccharomyc and schizosaccharomyc | sequenc | protein homolog | and express dure growth on glucos | we have the nucleotid sequenc of the gene for fructos | bisphosphatas from both saccharomyc and schizosaccharomyc | the protein sequenc for fructos | bisphosphatas from | contain amino acid and ha molecular weight of | that from | contain amino acid and ha molecular weight of | comparison of these amino acid sequenc with each other and that of pig kidnei fructos | bisphosphatas show sever region of strong homolog separ by region of diverg | these region ar like candid for function domain | gene cassett for fructos | bisphosphatas from | and the gene cassett from the and gal promot of yeast | yeast cell express fructos | bisphosphatas | while grow on glucos | accumul larg amount of intracellularli | suggest that glucos proteolyt inactiv doe not oper effici under these condit | growth on glucos not by the express of fructos | bisphosphatas |
