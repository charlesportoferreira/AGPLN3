rapid isol of yeast plasmid as nativ chromatin | mani region of chromatin ar subject to dynamic chang | we have rapid method for isol of small chromatin templat from yeast which will facilit biochem analysi of chromatin composit | us the promot we show that templat from cell grown in induc or repress condit show nativ chromatin structur | thi method mai be wide applic as the chromatin structur at centromer | at ar and at part of the lacz region on two other plasmid ar after chromatin isol |
