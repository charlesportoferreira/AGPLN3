select of secretori protein encod gene by fusion with in saccharomyc | secretori protein encod gene of saccharomyc have been by novel procedur that is base on the function select of their fusion with acid phosphatas | apas | at the dna level | dna fragment that function replac the promot and signal sequenc encod region of the gene | encod apas | have been by posit select from pool of random dna fragment | five uniqu dna sequenc contain the promot | and encod signal sequenc have been | we have also the complet gene | ssp | encod on of these | secretori protein | ssp | gene disrupt studi have shown that the ssp gene is not essenti for viabil and growth | the ssp amino acid | aa | sequenc ha | ident with the middl aa residu of the chicken glycosylation site bind protein | howev | ssp disrupt not affect protein glycosylation in yeast | the present studi provid an altern approach for the isol of gene encod secretori protein | in contrast to classic genet approach that requir isol of function defect by gene isol by function complement | the present procedur should contribut to our understand of protein sort by permit the clone of gene encod protein target to differ organel in the secretori pathwai |
