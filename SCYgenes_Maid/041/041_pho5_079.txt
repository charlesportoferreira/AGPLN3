histon h n termin allow hyperactivation of the yeast gal gene in vivo | recent work ha shown that the yeast histon h n terminu | while not essenti for viabil | is for repress of the silent mate loci and activ of gal and promot | becaus histon h share mani structur featur with histon h and is intim associ with h in the assembl nucleosom | we whether h ha similar function | while the basic n termin domain of h is to be non essenti | delet of residu of thi amino acid protein allow viabil | it remov ha onli minor effect on mate | surprisingli | both delet | of residu | and acetyl site substitut | at residu | and | within the n terminu of h allow hyperactivation of the gal promot as well as number of other gal gene includ gal | gal and gal | to limit extent glucos repress is also allevi by h n termin delet | express of anoth induc promot | is shown to be rel unaffect | we conclud that the h and h n termini have differ function in both the repress of the silent mate loci and in the regul of gal |
