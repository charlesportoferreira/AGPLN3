increas the rate of chromatin remodel and gene activ novel role for the histon acetyltransferas gcn | histon acetyltransferas | hat | such as gcn plai role in transcript activ | howev | the major of constitut gene show no requir for gcn | and even gene | such as the yeast gene | do not seem to be significantli by it absenc under normal activ condit | here we show that even though the steadi state level of transcript is not by delet of gcn | the rate of activ follow phosphat starvat is significantli | thi delai in transcript activ is specif due to slow chromatin remodel of the promot | wherea the transmiss of the phosphat starvat signal to the promot progress at normal rate | chromatin remodel is equal in galactos induc promot variant in which the bind site have been by gal bind site | by contrast | activ of the gal gene by galactos addit occur with normal kinet | lack of the histon h n termini lead to similar delai in activ of the promot | these result indic that on import contribut of hat is to increas the rate of gene induct by acceler chromatin remodel | rather than to affect the final steadi state express level |
