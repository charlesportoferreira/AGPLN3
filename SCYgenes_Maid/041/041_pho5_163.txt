modul of chromatin structur associ with derepress of the acid phosphatas gene of saccharomyc | we have the chromatin structur of phosphat repress acid phosphatas gene | within yeast nuclei | under condit | low pi media | the gene is much more sensit to either dnase i or micrococc nucleas digest than is the gene | we have dnase i site uniqu to the activ gene near the | end of the acid phosphatas mrna and within region presum to function in the regul of the gene by pi | although the gene is packag into regularli space nucleosom | no detect phase relationship exist between nucleosom and dna sequenc under condit | wherea in the state the nucleosom occur in on predomin phase | these result demonstr revers chang in the chromatin structur of eukaryot gene system that directli correl with the function state of the gene |
