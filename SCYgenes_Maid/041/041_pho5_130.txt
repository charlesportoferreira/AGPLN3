lacz hybrid protein block transloc of nativ acid phosphatas in saccharomyc | of protein hybrid compos of variabl portion of the amino termin residu of the yeast phosphat repress acid phosphatas | product of | and an activ fragment of bacteri beta galactosidas ha been | when these lacz hybrid ar in yeast strain carri an intact chromosom gene | thei show size depend interfer with the secret of nativ acid phosphatas | hybrid protein contain approxim residu of acid phosphatas do not affect secret of nativ acid phosphatas | hybrid contain greater than residu of acid phosphatas reduc the amount of acid phosphatas more than by | the interfer with secret is specif for acid phosphatas | the hybrid do not affect secret of invertas | and do not confer growth defici phenotyp on yeast | both the hybrid protein and acid phosphatas accumul in non | membran form which ar sensit to proteolysi from the cytoplasmic side of the membran | the hybrid and accumul acid phosphatas co migrat on percol densiti gradient with marker of the endoplasm reticulum | but not with marker of the golgi or secretori vesicl | these result suggest that lacz hybrid protein specif block secret of nativ acid phosphatas by interf with after target but befor transloc across the endoplasm reticulum |
