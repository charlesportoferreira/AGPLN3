the yeast nua and drosophila msl complex contain subunit import for transcript regul | in drosophila | the msl complex is for the dosag compens of x gene in male and contain histon acetyltransferas | mof | point mutat in the mof acetyl coa bind site result in male specif lethal | yeast esap | mof homolog | is essenti for cell cycle progress and is the catalyt subunit of the nua acetyltransferas complex | here we report that nua from yeast with point mutat in the acetyl coa bind domain of esap exhibit strong decreas in histon acetyltransferas activ | yet ha no effect on growth | we demonstr that eafp | esap associ factor protein | yeast protein to the drosophila dosag compens protein msl | is also stabl compon of the nua complex | unlik other subunit of the complex | it is not essenti | and the delet mutant ha no growth phenotyp | nua from the mutant strain ha appar molecular mass | but retain wild type level of histon h acetyltransferas activ | the eaf delet and the esa mutat lead to decreas in gene express | the eaf delet also significantli reduc hi and trp express | these result | togeth with those previous with both the msl and nua complex | underscor the import of target histon h acetyl for the gene specif activ of transcript |
