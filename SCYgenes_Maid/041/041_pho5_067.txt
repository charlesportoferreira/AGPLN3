the transcript factor | the cdk | it cyclin and their regul | direct the transcript respons to nutrit signal | the cyclin cdk complex prevent transcript of by inhibit the abil of the basic helix loop helix transcript factor to activ transcript in respons to high phosphat condit | in low phosphat the complex is and is then abl to activ the acid phosphatas gene | we show here that and the homeobox protein interact in vivo and act cooper to activ the ua | with interact be by the phosphat switch | in addit | we also demonstr that an addit factor | interact in high phosphat with both the cyclin and with | in low phosphat | and dissoci from | but retain the abil to interact with each other | the evid here support the idea that act as phosphat sensit trigger that regul the abil of the cyclin cdk complex to bind | while dna bind by is depend on the phosphat sensit interact with |
