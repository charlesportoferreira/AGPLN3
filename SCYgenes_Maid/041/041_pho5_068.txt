phosphoryl of the transcript factor by cyclin cdk complex | induct of the yeast gene is mediat by the transcript factor and | transcript is not detect in high phosphat | it is that the neg regul and inactiv and | here it is that ha homolog to yeast cyclin and interact with | pcdc | cdc protein kinas | the complex phosphoryl | thi phosphoryl is with neg regul of | these result demonstr the exist of cyclin cdk complex that is for regulatori process other than cell cycle control and identifi physiologicalli relev substrat for thi complex |
