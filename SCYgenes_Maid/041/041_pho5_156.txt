express of the human salivari alpha amylase gene in yeast and character of the protein | recombin plasmid in which the human salivari alpha amylase gene | with or without the n termin signal sequenc for secret | under control of the apas | promot of saccharomyc | in yeast cell with the alpha amylase gene have the human signal sequenc for secret | the gene and the into the medium in three differ form | the amylase gene without the signal sequenc also in yeast | but the product neither nor | determin of the n termin amino acid | aa | sequenc that the aa signal sequenc been cleav from the | and that the n termin | glutamin | been modifi into pyroglutamate | as is commonli with the mammalian salivari alpha amylase | thu | the human salivari alpha amylase signal sequenc for secret correctli and by the yeast secretori pathwai | the termin as leucin | which is from the nucleotid sequenc data to be at posit in front of the termin codon | therefor | there is no post translat process in format of the terminu |
