molecular analysi of the gene of saccharomyc | the gene product is posit regulatori factor for the synthesi of the phosphat repress acid phosphatas | by the gene | in saccharomyc | genet analysi ha that mai be the signal acceptor molecul | howev | the biochem function of the gene product is not known | we have the gene and the promot | lacz fusion shown to be valid report sinc it express is by the level of inorgan phosphat and is by the same regulatori factor that regul express | to elucid the mechan by which function | we have and domin in the gene which confer constitut synthesi of acid phosphatas | we have that overexpress of the neg regulatori factor | but not the neg regulatori factor | partial block the constitut acid phosphatas synthesi in strain contain domin constitut allel of | thi suggest that mai function by interact with or that these molecul compet for the same target |
