nucleosom disrupt at the yeast promot upon induct occur in the absenc of dna replic | activ of the gene in | by phosphat starvat previous shown to be accompani by the disappear of four nucleosom from the promot | to investig the mechan | we the gene | neg regul of | by temperatur sensit allel | as consequ | can be in the presenc of phosphat by temperatur shift from degre to degre | under these condit | the promot undergo the same chromatin transit as in phosphat cell | disrupt of the nucleosom by the temperatur shift also occur when dna replic is | nucleosom re form when the temperatur is from degre back to degre in nondivid cell | glucos is for the disrupt of the nucleosom dure the temperatur upshift | not for their re format dure the temperatur downshift | these experi prove that dna replic is not for the transit between the nucleosom and the non nucleosom state at the promot |
