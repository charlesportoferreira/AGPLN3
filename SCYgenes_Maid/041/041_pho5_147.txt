multipl global regul control hi transcript in yeast | gene express is depend on the interact of dna bind factor with distinct promot control element to activ rna synthesi | the express of the hi gene in yeast is under two differ control system | on of these | gener amino acid control | involv dna bind protein | gcn | that stimul transcript in respons to amino acid starvat by bind to | tgactc | sequenc in the hi promot region | second system | the basal level control | stimul hi transcript in the absenc of amino acid starvat | the basal level transcript of the hi gene is under the control of two gene | ba and ba | which ar also for the control of purin biosynthesi | in addit | ba is for the util of organ phosphat in the growth medium | genet map and dna sequenc analysi show that ba is | gene previous as regul of phosphat metabol | direct biochem analysi show that the ba gene encod protein that bind to both the hi and promot | the involv of singl dna bind protein in the regul of histidin | adenin | and phosphat metabol suggest that yeast mai us few kei dna bind protein to coordin the regul of divers metabol pathwai |
