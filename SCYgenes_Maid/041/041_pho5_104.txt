express of acid phosphatas beta galactosidas hybrid protein prevent transloc by deplet solubl factor | we have shown that hybrid protein compos of the yeast repress acid phosphatas | and bacteri beta galactosidas | lacz | interfer with secret of nativ acid phosphatas | wolf | j | biol | chem | we now report that lacz hybrid protein have more gener effect on secret and prevent transloc of sever protein | transloc of both the mate pheromon alpha factor and the proteas carboxypeptidas y is partial when lacz hybrid ar | cell fraction and proteas sensit indic that alpha factor and carboxypeptidas y accumul in precursor form on the cytoplasmic surfac of the endoplasm reticulum | indirect immunofluoresc with antibodi against beta galactosidas support the local of hybrid protein to the endoplasm reticulum | analysi of the hybrid protein phenotyp in vivo and in vitro suggest that the hybrid protein deplet solubl factor for effici transloc across the endoplasm reticulum | first | decreas in the express of hybrid protein in vivo decreas it effect on transloc | second | an in vitro translat | transloc reaction | from hybrid bear strain | is defici in it abil to transloc prepro alpha factor across yeast microsom membran | thi defici is by addit of cytosol from wild type cell | final | the hybrid protein phenotyp is shown to be independ of the requir for ssa gene product |
