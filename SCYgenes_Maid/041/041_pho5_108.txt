bacteri pbr sequenc serv as upstream activ sequenc in saccharomyc | the express of acid phosphatas | apas | from and mf alpha hybrid gene is by inorgan phosphat and mate type respect | as well as the and mat alpha gene product respect | when and mf alpha hybrid gene in the bamhi site of the pbr sequenc of the yeast shuttl vector | yrp or yept | in on orient thei normal but in the other orient their express not but constitut | the pbr sequenc present upstream of the gene ar respons for the constitut express | by replac the upstream activ sequenc | ua | element with pbr fragment | we have three pbr sequenc | from nucleotid to | to and to | which abl to promot express of apas | comparison of these three pbr fragment | atcgcgcgag | and | cggtgatgncgg | to be the common sequenc like to act as uass in saccharomyc | by us synthetic oligonucleotid | it that both sequenc ar for maximum express of apas activ |
