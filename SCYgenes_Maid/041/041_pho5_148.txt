molecular analysi of the dna sequenc in the transcript regul of the phosphat repress acid phosphatas gene | of saccharomyc | the express of the gene of saccharomyc is transcription in respons to the level of inorgan phosphat present in the growth medium | we have | by dna delet analysi | the sequenc | upstream activ sequenc | that mediat thi respons | the sequenc | ctgcacaaatg | is present in two copi within base pair region | the presenc of singl copi of the sequenc is suffici for the phosphat mediat transcript respons | in addit | dna fragment that contain two copi of thi sequenc will act to repress transcript of cyc lacz fusion when either upstream or downstream of the cyc activ sequenc |
