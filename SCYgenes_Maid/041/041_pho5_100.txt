myc and the yeast transcript factor share common cacgtg bind motif | the basic helix loop helix | hlh | motif is common to number of protein in transcript regul and cell type determin | the hlh motif is also present in the | transcript factor which posit regul the acid phosphatas gene | in thi report we show that the hlh region of is suffici to confer specif dna bind to the sequenc cacgtg and | by comparison of the basic region of with those of other recent cacgtg bind protein | we identifi specif subset of amino acid in the basic region like to confer dna bind specif | on the basi of these observ we predict successfulli the effect of substitut the basic region with that from myc and show that the chimaer protein activ transcript from the cacgtg element present in the ua | from these data it is clear that the myc basic region confer specif bind to the sequenc cacgtg |
