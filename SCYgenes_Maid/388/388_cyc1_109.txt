can tetraplex recombin model explain observ in mitot gene convers | mitot gene convers studi on the cyc gene of yeast have shown that the actual base pair chang | the type of chang | base substitut | delet or addit | and the distanc between all affect gene convers yield | in cross between less than four base apart | gene convers rate ar as low as back mutat rate | the same mutant to allel more than five base awai mai recombin fold more | in cross between five or more base pair apart | recombin rate vari by up to ten fold ar when compar at the same codon site | the actual in cross affect recombin rate at these distanc | the data rule out model in which mutant ar repair independ | model with larg gap at the initi site ar rule out if the mutant ar within the gap | recombin model ar favour in which both can interact at distanc to affect the probabl of recombin | such interact mai reflect the geometri of the recombin junction | the specif interact ar that the actual | and residu mismatch aris on excis resynthesi | affect both the further migrat of the recombin junction | and the probabl that excis repair will detect and correct residu mismatch | junction model in which interact ar expect includ those compos of base tetraplex | the data is in term of these model | meiotic recombin data is consist with these model |
