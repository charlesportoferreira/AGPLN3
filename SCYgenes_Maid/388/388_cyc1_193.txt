the role of the intern hydrogen bond network in first order protein electron transfer between saccharomyc iso cytochrome and bovin microsom cytochrome | an intern water molecul | wat | is in iso cytochrome which is part of redox state depend hydrogen bond network | the posit of thi water molecul with respect to the polypeptide fold can be or even by site mutagenesi lead to structur perturb and associ chang in redox potenti | us satur transfer h nmr method | thi studi measur chang in the electron transfer reactiv for three variant of yeast iso cytochrome in which the posit of thi water molecul is | in particular | the revers electron transfer rate is within complex between either wild type or variant yeast iso cytochrome and the tryptic fragment of bovin liver microsom cytochrome | for three variant of yeast iso cytochrome the rate constant by satur transfer ar wild type | asn | e mv | kex | asn ala | e mv | kex | asn il | e mv | kex | the first order rate ar with that of fourth variant phe gly which ha been previous | e mv | kex | an analysi of the variat in the cross exchang rate us marcu theori show that these chang can be quantit by the shift in redox potenti that accompani mutagenesi | so | although the perturb of the intern water molecul by mutagenesi alter both the structur and redox potenti of cytochrome | surprisingli it doe not significantli influenc the intrins electron transfer reactiv of the protein | studi of the activ paramet suggest that variat of temperatur chang both delta g | and also the prefactor | these data ar discuss in term of model involv dynamic molecular recognit between protein |
