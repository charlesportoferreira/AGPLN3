high resolut refin of yeast iso cytochrome and comparison with other eukaryot cytochrome | the structur of yeast iso cytochrome ha been refin against x rai diffract data to nomin resolut of | the atom model contain protein atom | as well as water molecul and on sulfat anion | also in the refin ar hydrogen atom belong to the protein molecul | the crystallographic r factor is | for the | reflect with f greater than or equal to sigma | f | in the resolut rang | to | co ordin accuraci is estim to be better than | the iso cytochrome molecul ha the typical cytochrome fold | with the polypeptide chain organ into seri of alpha helic and revers turn that serv to envelop the heme prosthet group in hydrophobic pocket | inspect of the conform of helic in the molecul show that the local environ of the helic | in particular the presenc of intrahel threonin residu | caus distort from ideal alpha helic geometri | analysi of the intern mobil of iso cytochrome | base on refin crystallographic temperatur factor | show that the most rigid part of the molecul ar those that ar close associ with the heme group | the degre of satur of hydrogen bond potenti is high | with | of all polar atom to particip in hydrogen bond | the geometri of intramolecular hydrogen bond is typical of that in other high resolut protein structur | the water molecul present in the model repres about | of those expect to be present in the asymmetric unit | the major of the water molecul ar organ into small number of hydrogen bond network that ar anchor to the protein surfac | comparison of the structur of yeast iso cytochrome with those of tuna and rice cytochrome show that these three molecul have veri high structur similar | with the atom pack in the heme crevic region be particularli highli | larg conform differ that ar between these cytochrome can be explain by amino acid substitut | addit subtl differ in the posit of the side chain of sever highli residu ar also and occur due to uniqu featur in the local environ of each cytochrome molecul | abstract at word |
