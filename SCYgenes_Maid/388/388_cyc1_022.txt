rna polymerase ii and tbp occupi the cyc promot | saccharomyc cyc gene express ha been in great detail with regard to the respons to oxygen avail and carbon sourc | in the absenc of oxygen and the presenc of glucos | the cyc gene is complet | chromatin structur is to plai an import role in cyc gene regul | as nucleosom deplet result in fold derepress | in addit | the cyc core promot ha been extens in hybrid construct to studi activ by heterolog transcript factor | therefor | we out to map the chromatin structur of the cyc promot and determin it role in cyc gene regul | we report here that the cyc promot contain no nucleosom over the core promot | howev | we find tfiid and rna polymerase ii in complex on the promot | these result indic that recruit of tfiid and rna polymerase ii ar not rate limit step in cyc activ |
