nmr analysi of cyp | dna bind domain cyc upstream activ sequenc interact | recognit of cgg trinucleotid and of an addit thymine bp downstream by the zinc cluster and the n termin extrem of the protein | the dna bind domain of the yeast transcript activ cyp | contain zinc cluster structur | the structur of the dna bind domain dna complex of two other zinc cluster protein | gal and ppr | have been by x rai crystallographi | their bind domain present | besid the zinc cluster | short linker peptid and dimer element | thei recogn | as homodim | two rotation symmetric cgg trinucleotid | the linker peptid and the dimer element plai crucial role in bind specif | surprisingli | cyp recogn degener form of direct repeat | cggnnntancggnnnta | and the role of it linker is under discuss | to better understand the bind specif of cyp | we have | by nmr | the interact between the cyp | peptid and two dna fragment from the cyc upstream activ sequenc | our data indic that cyp | interact with cgg and with thymine bp downstream | the cgg trinucleotid is by the zinc cluster in the major groov | as for gal and ppr | and the thymine is in the minor groov by the n termin region | which possess basic stretch of arginyl and lysyl residu | thi suggest that the cyp | n termin region could plai role in the affin and | or specif of the interact with it dna target | in contrast to gal and ppr |
