cytochrome peroxidas bind two molecul of cytochrome | evid for low affin | electron transfer activ site on cytochrome peroxidas | we have the affin and stoichiometri of bind of cytochrome | cc | to zinc cytochrome peroxidas | znp | ccp | which is structur and electrostat equival to ferrou ccp | transient absorpt spectroscopi ha been to measur both the total quench of the triplet state | znp | ccp | znp | ccp | by fe | cc and the fraction of that quench that is due to electron transfer | et | thi redox quench result in the format of an intermedi | i | contain the zinc porphyrin pi cation radic | znp | ccp | and fe | cc | in titrat of | znp | ccp with fe | cc | f | at low ionic strength | where f repres the fungal cytochrome from candida krusei | pichia membranefacien | or the yeast protein iso | the appear of the et intermedi lag behind the total quench | with appreci format of i occur onli for cc to ccp ratio | thi behavior result from the format of | complex | where on fe | cc | f | bind to high affin domain that exhibit strong quench yet is et inact | while the second fe | cc | f | bind to low affin domain that allow effici et quench | at constant concentr of both protein | rais the ionic strength elimin most of the et quench but reduc the total quench onli minim | confirm that et occur preferenti at the low affin bind domain | which is the more sensit to ionic strength | analog experi also favor | bind stoichiometri for hors cc | cc | hors | at low ionic strength | with et quench again proceed much more favor in the | complex than in the | complex | as with cc | f | howev | the fe | cc | hors | quench onli by electron transfer | unlik the cc | f | the decai of the triplet state | znp | ccp or magnesium ccp | mgp | ccp | dure titrat with fe | cc to determin limit for the dissoci rate constant | koff | for the complex | fe | cc | hors | to the high affin domain in | complex at low ionic strength is in rapid exchang | with koff | wherea fe | cc | f | ha koff lt | both type of fe | cc have koff | when thei ar to the low affin domain in | complex | at both low and high ionic strength | in contrast | when in the ferrou form | both type of cc have much lower valu of koff | lt | at low ionic strength when to the low affin domain | abstract at word |
