yeast iso cytochrome | resolut three dimension structur determin | molecular replac approach | augment with the result of predict model procedur | solvent access studi | pack analys and translat coeffici search | ha been to elucid the | nm | resolut structur of yeast iso cytochrome | an examin of the polypeptide chain fold of thi protein show it to have uniqu conform in three region | upon comparison with the structur of other eukaryot cytochrome | these includ | residu to | at the n termin end of the polypeptide chain | which ar in an conform and project in larg part off the surfac of the protein | residu to | which form surfac beta loop on the hi ligand side of the central heme group | and | the termin end of the helic segment compos of residu to | which serv to form part of the heme pocket | structur studi also show that the highli reactiv sulfhydryl group of cy is buri within hydrophobic region in the monom form of yeast iso cytochrome | dimer of yeast iso cytochrome through disulfid bond format between two such residu would requir substanti conform chang in the termin helix of thi protein | anoth uniqu structur featur | the trimethyl side chain of ly | is on the surfac of yeast iso cytochrome near the solvent expos edg of the heme prosthet group | on the basi of the result of these and other structur studi | an analysi of the spatial conserv of structur featur in the heme pocket of eukaryot cytochrome ha been conduct | it that the residu could be divid into three gener class | the current structur analys and addit model studi have also been to explain the function properti for mutant yeast iso cytochrome protein |
