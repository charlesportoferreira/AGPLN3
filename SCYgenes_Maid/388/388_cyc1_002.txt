evalu of cooper interact between substructur of iso cytochrome us doubl mutant cycle | doubl mutant cycle ha been to evalu interact energi between the global stabil mutat asparagin | isoleucin | ni | in iso cytochrome and produc singl surfac histidin at posit | and | these histidin mutat site ar distribut through the four cooper fold unit of cytochrome | the doubl mutant cycle start with the iso cytochrome variant actm | variant with no surfac histidin and with asparagin at posit | isoleucin is singli at posit | actmi variant | as ar the surfac histidin | achx variant | where x indic the histidin sequenc posit | the doubl mutant variant | achxi | provid the remain corner of the doubl mutant cycle | the stabil of all variant by guanidin hydrochloride denatur and interact energi between posit and each histidin site | six of the seven doubl mutant show addit | achi | achi | achi | achi | and achi | stabil effect or weak interact energi | achi | of the histidin and the ni mutat | consist with cooper effect on protein fold and stabil be spars distribut through the protein structur | the achi variant show strong favor interact energi | kcal | mol | between the ni mutat in on substructur and the addit of hi to an adjac substructur | the data ar consist with an entrop stabil of the intersubstructur hydrogen bond between hi and glu by the il mutat |
