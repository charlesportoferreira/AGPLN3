infer genet network from dna microarrai data by multipl regress analysi | infer gene regulatori network by differenti equat from the time seri data of dna microarrai is on of the most challeng task in the post genom era | howev | there have been no studi actual infer gene regulatori network by differenti equat from genom level data | the reason for thi is that the number of paramet in the equat exce the number of time point | we here in execut the infer | not by directli determin paramet but by appli multipl regress analysi to our equat | we our differenti equat and steadi state equat from the rate equat of transcript reaction in an organ | verif with number of gene to respir the valid and effect of our method | moreov | the steadi state equat more appropri than the differenti equat for the microarrai data |
