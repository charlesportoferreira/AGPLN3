rna polymerase ii subunit rpb is for accur start site select | the divers function of saccharomyc rna polymerase ii ar partit among it subunit | rpb rpb | although multipl function have been assign to the three largest subunit | rpb | rpb | and rpb | the function of the remain smaller subunit ar unknown | we have the function of on of the smaller subunit | rpb | by demonstr that it is necessari for accur start site select | transcript in the absenc of rpb initi farther upstream at new and previous minor start site both at the cyc promot in vitro and at the cyc | adh | hi | hb | and rpb promot in vivo | immunoprecipit of rna polymerase ii from cell lack the rpb gene that all of the remain subunit ar assembl into the | suggest that the start site defect is attribut sole to the absenc of rpb | in support of thi hypothesi | we have shown that addit of wild type recombin rpb complet correct for the start site defect seen in vitro | recombin rpb protein | with an alter in metal bind domain for high temperatur growth and accur start site select in vivo | at least fold less effect at correct the start site defect in vitro | rpb appear to plai uniqu role in transcript initi | as the defect in it absenc ar distinct from those seen with mutant in rna polymerase subunit rpb and factor e | tfiib | two other yeast protein also in start site select |
