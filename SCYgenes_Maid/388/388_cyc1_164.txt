effect of the asn il mutat on the redox potenti of yeast cytochrome | theori and experi | theoret method for correl of sequenc chang and redox potenti of electron transport protein ar us the asn il mutat in cytochrome as test case | the first approach us the protein dipol langevin dipol | pdld | method and the high resolut x rai structur of the nativ and the mutant protein | thi approach is to give reliabl result where all the solvent molecul ar by langevin dipol and also when some water molecul ar explicitli | free energi perturb method is also to give reason result but at the expens of much more comput time | final | an approach that gener mutant structur from the nativ structur by molecular dynamic simul and then us these configur in pdld calcul is to give reason estim of the effect of the mutat on the correspond redox potenti | the encourag result here and in preliminari test case of the phe ser mutat indic that the present strategi can provid us tool for structur redox and sequenc redox correl in protein |
