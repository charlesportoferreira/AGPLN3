function express of rat cytochrome in saccharomyc | to determin whether mammalian cytochrome could effici replac iso cytochrome | which is by the yeast cyc gene | the code sequenc of rc | nondefect gene from rat | in both singl and multipl copi express vector under the direct of the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase | adc | promot | upon transform of cyc delet strain | the multipl copi construct wild type growth rate on lactat medium | such growth normal requir amount of iso cytochrome | these transform level of hybrid adc | rc mrna approxim to fold greater than the amount of messag from the endogen adc gene and steadi state level of rat cytochrome equival to that of the wild type yeast protein | requir for the vector evidenc by it absenc in all transform that the lactat growth phenotyp after propag in nonselect medium | in contrast | the level of vector specif messag in singl copi equival to that of the endogen adc mrna | but transform no signific growth on lactat | construct have small delet or mammalian intron within the rat cytochrome code region to support lactat depend growth | indic that complement depend upon proper translat of the correct rat code sequenc | therefor | the rat polypeptide | when at normal physiological level | is by the yeast machineri in the multipl step for the process and transport of an activ cytochrome as well as it function interact with the respiratori apparatu |
