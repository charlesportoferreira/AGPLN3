differenti regul of the isocytochrom gene in yeast | the two unlink gene cyc and cyc iso cytochrome and iso cytochrome | respect | in the yeast saccharomyc | an examin of the steadi state level of cyc and cyc mrna in normal and mutant strain grown under differ condit | along with previou result of apoprotein level | demonstr that cyc and cyc have similar and differ mode of regul | both cyc and cyc mrna ar after anaerob growth | in contrast | cyc mrna but not cyc mrna is by heme defici in hem mutant | although both cyc and cyc mrna ar substanti after growth in glucos medium | there is differ in the kinet of glucos derepress | cyc mrna level rise in the earli logarithm phase of growth befor complet exhaust of glucos | wherea cyc mrna level rise in the late logarithm phase when the level of cyc mrna ha plateau | for brief period befor cessat of growth | the level of cyc mrna attain level correspond to the high level of cyc mrna | the high amount of cyc mrna is surpris becaus iso cytochrome constitut onli | of the total cytochrome complement in cell | we suggest that iso cytochrome ha the potenti to compris major proport of cytochrome under certain physiologic condit that have not been experiment | the cyc mutant | which lack the abil to attach heme group to apocytochrom | contain both cyc and cyc mrna in normal amount | yet | cyc mutant contain onli apoiso cytochrome and not apoiso cytochrome | the lack of accumul of apoiso cytochrome in cyc mutant | which contain cyc mrna | suggest that apoiso cytochrome is extens by post transcript process |
