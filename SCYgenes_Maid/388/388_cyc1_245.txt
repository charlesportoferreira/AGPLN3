oxygen depend upstream activ site of saccharomyc cytochrome gene ar form of the same sequenc | in saccharomyc | the two gene | cyc and cyc | that the isoform of cytochrome ar at differ level | oxygen regul is mediat by the express of the cyp gene | and the cyp protein interact with both cyc upstream activ sequenc | ua | and cyc uaso | in thi studi | the homolog between the cyp bind site of both gene | the most notic differ between the cyc and cyc uass is the presenc of gc base pair at the same posit in sequenc in cyc with cg base pair in cyc | mutagenesi chang these gc residu to cg residu in cyc to cyc like express of cyc both in cyp wild type strain and in strain carri the semidomin mutat cyp which revers the oxygen depend express of the two gene | our result strongli support the hypothesi that the cyp bind site in cyc and cyc ar form of the same sequenc and that the cyp protein ha specif for the variant form of the consensu sequenc in both gene |
