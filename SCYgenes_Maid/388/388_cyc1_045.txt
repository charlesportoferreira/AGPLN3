assign of n chemic shift and n relax measur for and iso cytochrome | protocol for complet isotop label of iso cytochrome from the eukaryot saccharomyc is | assign ar for the vast major of the n amid reson in both and state | n heteronuclear relax experi collect to studi the picosecond nanosecond backbon dynamic of thi protein | relax rate comput and fit to spectral densiti function by model free analysi | backbon amid in the overlap loop | region ar the most flexibl on the picosecond nanosecond time scale in both form of the protein | the result show that | on averag | the protein backbon is slightli more dynamic in the than the state | though not significantli so | exchang term | which suggest signific motion on time scale at least an order of magnitud slower than the overal correl time of | ns | for onli two residu in the state and residu in the state | when on per basi | the lower order paramet in the state scatter throughout the protein | with few continu segment in loop and the termin helix | suggest greater flexibl of these region in the state | the result provid dynamic interpret for previous structur and function data | includ redox depend chang that occur in the protein | the wai is now pave for extens dynamic analysi of variant cytochrome |
