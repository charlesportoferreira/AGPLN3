posit regulatori site and neg regulatori site control the express of the saccharomyc cyc gene | seri of bal delet in vitro in the upstream region of the saccharomyc cyc gene | encod the iso cytochrome protein | these delet two site which plai role in govern the express of thi gene | posit site | the delet of which to cyc express | ca | base pair | to the translat initi codon | neg site | the delet of which to greatli level of cyc express | at ca | bp | delet of both these site in low wild type like express of the gene | therefor | these two site appear to act antagonist to give the low wild type level of cyc express | within the region as contain the posit site | there is sequenc which bear some homolog to the upstream activ site in the gene | cyc | encod the iso cytochrome protein |
