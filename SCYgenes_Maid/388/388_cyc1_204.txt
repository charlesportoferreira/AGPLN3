assign of proton reson | identif of secondari structur element | and analysi of backbon chemic shift for the ct variant of yeast iso cytochrome and hors cytochrome | reson assign for the main chain | side chain | exchang side chain | and heme proton of the ct variant of saccharomyc iso cytochrome in both oxid state | with the except of gly | ar | we have also independ assign hors cytochrome | some addit assign for the hors protein extend those of wand and co worker | wand | j | di stefano | d | l | feng | y | roder | h | amp | england | w | biochemistri | feng | y | roder | h | england | w | wand | j | amp | di stefano | d | l | biochemistri | qualit interpret of nuclear overhaus enhanc data allow the secondari structur of these two protein to be rel to crystal structur | comparison of the chemic shift of the backbon proton of the ct variant and hors protein reveal signific differ result from amino acid substitut at posit and and further substitut between and | although the overal fold of yeast iso cytochrome and hors cytochrome is veri similar | there can be larg differ in chemic shift for structur equival residu | chemic shift differ of amid proton | and to lesser extent alpha proton | repres minut chang in hydrogen bond | therefor | great care must be taken in the us of differ in chemic shift as evid for structur chang even between highli protein |
