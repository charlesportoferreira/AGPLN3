interact between yeast iso cytochrome and it peroxidas | isotherm titrat calorimetri to studi the format of complex involv yeast iso ferricytochrom | cc | and ferricytochrom peroxidas | ccp | the complex combin of the wild type protein | six ccp variant | and three cc variant | sixteen protein combin to probe the crystallographicalli interfac between cc and ccp | the data show that the high affin site on cc and ccp coincid with the crystallographicalli site | chang residu to alanin increas the enthalpi of complex format by constant amount | but the decreas in stabil depend on the locat of the amino acid substitut | delet methyl group ha small effect on the bind enthalpi and larger deleteri effect on the bind free energi | consist with model studi of the hydrophobic effect | and show that nonpolar interact also stabil the complex | doubl mutant cycle to determin the coupl energi for nine cc ccp pair | compar these energi to the crystal structur of the complex lead to the conclus that mani of the substitut induc rearrang of the complex |
