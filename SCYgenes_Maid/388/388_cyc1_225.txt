coupl of heme attach to import of cytochrome into yeast mitochondria | studi with heme lyase defici mitochondria and apocytochrom | cytochrome is in the cytoplasm as apocytochrom | lack heme | and then import into mitochondria | the relationship between attach of heme to the apoprotein and it import into mitochondria us an in vitro system | apocytochrom transcrib and translat in vitro could be import with high effici into mitochondria from normal yeast strain | howev | no import of apocytochrom with mitochondria from cyc strain | which lack cytochrome heme lyase | the catalyz coval attach of heme to apocytochrom | in addit | amino acid substitut in apocytochrom at either of the cysteine residu that ar the site of the thioether linkag to heme | or at an immedi adjac histidin that serv as ligand of the heme iron | in substanti reduct in the abil of the precursor to be into mitochondria | replac of the methionin serv as the other iron ligand | on the other hand | no detect effect on import of apocytochrom in thi system | thu | coval heme attach is step for import of cytochrome into mitochondria | heme attach | howev | can occur in the absenc of mitochondri import sinc we have cyc heme lyase activ in solubil yeast extract and in an escherichia coli express system | these result suggest that protein fold trigger by heme attach to apocytochrom is for import into mitochondria |
