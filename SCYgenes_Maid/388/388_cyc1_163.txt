oxid state depend conform chang in cytochrome | high resolut three dimension structur analys of yeast iso cytochrome have now been in both oxid state us isomorph crystalline materi and similar structur determin methodolog | thi approach ha comprehens comparison to be between these structur and the elucid of the subtl conform chang occur between oxid state | the structur solut of yeast iso cytochrome ha been publish and the determin of the protein and comparison of these structur ar herein | our data show that oxid state depend chang ar for the most part in term of adjust to heme structur | movement of intern water molecul and segment thermal paramet chang along the polypeptide chain | rather than as explicit polypeptide chain posit shift | which ar to be minim | thi result is emphas by the retent of all main chain to main chain hydrogen bond interact in both oxid state | thermal factor chang primarili affect four segment of polypeptide chain | residu show less mobil in the state | with arg and it side chain be most | in contrast | residu | and have significantli higher thermal factor | with maxim increas be for asn | tyr and phe | the side chain of two of these residu ar hydrogen to the intern water molecul | wat | which show larg | displac toward the posit heme iron atom in the protein | further analys suggest that wat is major factor in stabil both oxid state of the heme through differenti orient of dipol moment | shift in distanc to the heme iron atom and alter in the surround hydrogen bond network | it also seem like that wat movement lead to the disrupt of the hydrogen bond from the side chain of tyr to the heme ligand | therebi further stabil the posit heme iron atom in cytochrome | in total | there appear to be three region about which oxid state depend structur chang ar focuss | these includ the pyrrole ring propion group | wat and the heme ligand | all three of these foci ar togeth by network of intermediari interact and ar to the ligand side of the heme group | associ with each is correspond nearbi segment of polypeptide chain have substanti higher mobil in the protein | abstract at word |
