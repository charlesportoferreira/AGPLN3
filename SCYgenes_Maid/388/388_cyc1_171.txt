the function of the saccharomyc iso cytochrome gene is independ of the codon at invari phe when the gene is present on low copi number vector | phe is the most invari of cytochrome | howev | the physiological relev of amino acid substitut at thi posit is unclear becaus previou studi either in vitro | i | e | us protein | or in yeast where the gene for the protein is present on multi copi vector | multi copi vector yield level of cytochrome in yeast that is greater than the wild type level | oligodeoxyribonucleotid mutagenesi to chang the codon for phe to that of the other natur occur amino acid as well as the amber stop codon | the allel ar present on yeast shuttl phagemid contain the cen gene which ensur vector copi number of on to two in yeast | all the missens allel support growth under condit requir function iso cytochrome | howev the fc | fp | and fr variant grow at significantli lower rate | after select for function | phagemid from the transform and the ident of the mutat verifi | it is that all amino acid ar capabl of support function | reason for the evolutionari invari of phe ar discuss |
