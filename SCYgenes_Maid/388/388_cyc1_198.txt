differenti stabil of two apo isocytochrom in the yeast saccharomyc | the yeast saccharomyc contain two form of cytochrome | iso cytochrome and iso cytochrome | by the gene cyc and cyc | respect | the amino acid sequenc of these two isozym ar approxim | ident | cyc mutant lack both holocytochrom | becaus of defici of cytochrome heme lyase | the catalyz coval attach of the heme group to apocytochrom | defici of heme lyase also prevent import into mitochondria | surprisingli | apo iso cytochrome is absent in cyc strain | although apo iso cytochrome is present at approxim the same level at which holo iso cytochrome is in cyc | strain | the lack of apo iso cytochrome is not due to defici of either transcript or translat | but to rapid degrad of the protein | apocytochrom by composit cytochrome gene compos of the central portion of iso cytochrome flank by amino and carboxyl region of iso cytochrome exhibit stabil with apo iso cytochrome | region encompass no more than four amino acid differ between iso and iso cytochrome is suffici to partial stabil the protein | in contrast to what is in vivo with the apo form | the holo form of the composit isocytochrom ar even less stabl to thermal denatur than iso cytochrome or iso cytochrome | either small region of the sequenc of apo iso cytochrome is in degrad of the protein | or the correspond region in apo iso cytochrome is prevent degrad | the differenti stabil of the two isocytochrom mai be part of regulatori process that increas the proport of iso cytochrome under certain physiological condit |
