control of translat initi in saccharomyc | the first observ regard the control of translat initi in the yeast saccharomyc by fred sherman and hi colleagu in | eleg genet studi of the cyc gene in the formul of | sherman | rule | for translat initi as follow | i | aug is the onli initi codon | ii | the most proxim aug from the | end of messag will serv as the start site of translat | and | iii | if the upstream aug codon is then initi begin at the next avail aug in the messag | hidden within these rule is the mechan of eukaryot translat initi | as these veri same rule later shown to appli to higher eukaryot organ and formul into the scan model | howev | onli in the past five year ha yeast been taken serious as an organ for studi the mechan of eukaryot translat initi | the basi for thi is that the yeast gene for at least four mammalian translat initi factor homologu have been and the number is grow | similar factor suggest similar mechan for translat initi between yeast and mammal | for some translat initi factor | the genet of yeast ha new insight into their function | mechan for regul translat initi in mammalian cell is now evid in yeast | it seem clear that the molecular genet of yeast coupl with the avail in vitro translat system will provid wealth of inform in the futur regard translat control and regulatori mechan | the purpos of thi review is to summar what is known about translat control in |
