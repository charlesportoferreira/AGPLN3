equilibrium thermodynam of physiologicalli relev heme protein complex | we isotherm titrat calorimetri to studi the equilibrium thermodynam for format of the physiologicalli relev redox protein complex between yeast ferricytochrom and yeast ferricytochrom peroxidas | bind stoichiometri | and the bind free energi agre with result from other techniqu | the bind is either enthalpi or entropi driven depend on the condit | and the heat capac chang upon bind is neg | increas the ionic strength destabil the complex | and both the bind enthalpi and entropi increas | increas the temperatur stabil the complex | indic posit van | t hoff bind enthalpi | yet the calorimetr bind enthalpi is neg | to | kcal mol | we suggest that thi discrep is by solvent reorgan in an intermedi state | the enthalpi and heat capac chang ar in reason agreement with the valu estim from the surfac area chang upon complex format | these result ar to those for format of the hors ferricytochrom | yeast ferricytochrom peroxidas complex | the result suggest that the crystal and solut structur for the yeast complex ar the same | while the crystal and solut structur for hors cytochrome | yeast cytochrome peroxidas ar differ |
