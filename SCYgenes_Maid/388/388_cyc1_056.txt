the yeast mitochondri intermembran space | purif and analysi of two distinct fraction | we have protocol for the sequenti releas of the intermembran space | im | content of saccharomyc mitochondria | two distinct fraction | solubl im with cytochrome as kei marker and salt extract im with cytochrome as kei marker | the ident of sever protein by amino termin amino acid sequenc | the im fraction devoid of contamin from cytosol and mitochondri outer and inner membran | by subtract analysi | the protein profil of solubl and salt extract im fraction deplet of contamin band from matrix protein | the fraction method will provid the basi for the further analysi of im protein and character of their function in bioenerget | mitochondri biogenesi | and regulatori process |
