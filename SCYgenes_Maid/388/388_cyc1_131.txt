yeast gal protein is distinct type transcript factor that enhanc basal transcript in vitro | the yeast auxiliari transcript factor gal | candid for the coactiv | partial from yeast cell | and it function in cell free transcript system | the partial gal protein basal transcript from the cyc core promot by factor of at the step of preiniti complex format | gal protein also transcript by gener regulatori factor | gal ah | or gal vp to the same extent as the basal transcript | therefor | the appar potenti of the activ by gal attribut to the stimul of basal transcript | the wild type gal protein | but not mutant type protein | in bacteria transcript as effect as gal from yeast | these result suggest that gal function as posit cofactor of basal and activ transcript in cell free transcript system |
