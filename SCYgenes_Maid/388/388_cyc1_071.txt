molecular dynamic studi in explicit water of the and form of yeast iso cytochrome solvat and dynamic properti of the two oxid state | molecular dynamic calcul have been over long trajectori with the inclus of explicit solvent molecul on the and the state of yeast iso cytochrome | the result structur have been and both in term of structur properti and dynamical behavior | the structur of the buri water molecul around the heme ha been also for the two oxid state and with the experiment observ on the x rai and the solut nmr structur | from the overal analysi we learn that | as also experiment through nmr | no signific differ ar present between the structur of the two oxid state besid the arrang of few side chain | also the intern mobil is similar for the two oxid state | even if interest differ ar for some residu | as for tyr | present at the heme site | the locat and the mobil of the order water molecul | in solut by nmr | ar complet reproduc in the molecular dynamic simul | which have been abl to predict the differ displac of the catalyt relev water molecul wat | similar to those in solut for the two oxid state | at varianc with that in the start crystallographic structur | the relev of these find with respect to the predict of structur and dynamical properti is discuss |
