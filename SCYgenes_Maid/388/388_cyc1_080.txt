proton nmr assign and magnet ax orient for wild type yeast iso ferricytochrom free in solut and to cytochrome peroxidas | extens proton hyperfine reson assign have been for wild type yeast iso ferricytochrom when it is free in solut and when it is noncoval complex to rest state cytochrome peroxidas | complet heme proton reson assign for free iso ferricytochrom | while for ccp complex iso ferricytochrom | of heme proton assign | addit proton reson assign for hyperfine proton of amino acid near the heme | these assign identif of the most extens of complex proton shift yet for ccp | cytochrome complex | sever pure dipolar reson from heme vicin amino acid proton also assign in both free and complex iso ferricyt | both set of reson assign assess of the origin of proton complex shift | us the assign dipolar proton reson as basi | the orient of the princip axi system of the paramagnet suscept tensor for free and cytochrome peroxidas iso ferricytochrom elucid | the result that the iso ferricytochrom magnet axi system orient shift significantli upon complex format | the direct of the complex shift for heme proton reson is larg for by the magnet anisotropi chang | howev | analysi of heme complex shift also reveal local chang in magnet environ for two heme substitu | presum through specif structur chang |
