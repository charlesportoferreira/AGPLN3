yeast activ compet with the factor rc for bind to the upstream activ site ua of the cyc gene | we show that the yeast activ encod protein that bind in vitro to the upstream activ site | ua | of the cyc gene | iso cytochrome | bind of wild type and deriv to ua is evid in crude fraction yeast extract us the gel electrophoresi dna bind assai | the bind of in vitro | like the activ of ua in vivo | is by heme | bind to region | on of two portion of ua shown to be import by genet analysi of the site | surprisingli | bind to the same sequenc as second factor | rc | both and rc bind to the same side of the helix | and make similar but not ident major and minor groov contact that span two full turn | an addit factor that bind to the second import part of ua | the region factor | raf | is also | model depict the interplai of | rc | and raf in the control of ua is |
