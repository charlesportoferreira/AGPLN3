two type of tata element for the cyc gene of the yeast saccharomyc | function tata element in the | untransl region of the cyc gene in the yeast saccharomyc have been by transcript analysi of site | five site previous to contain function tata element individu and in all possibl combin | the result that onli two element ar for transcript at the normal level and the normal start site | the two function tata element ar at site and | where the of the atg start codon is assign nucleotid posit | thei direct initi within window encompass to and to | respect | onli when both of the upstream tata site nonfunct the third and fourth downstream tata like sequenc | as by the presenc of low level of transcript start at | the two upstream function tata element in sequenc | the sequenc of the most | on at site | beta type | atatatatat | wherea that of the second on at site | alpha type | tatataaaa | the follow rearrang of the beta type and alpha type element at two site | and | site beta site alpha | site alpha site beta | site alpha site alpha | and site beta site beta | when differ type at differ site | site beta site alpha and site alpha site beta | both equal | in contrast | when the same type present at both site | site alpha site alpha and site beta site beta | onli the upstream element | we suggest that the two tata element ar by differ factor of the transcript apparatu |
