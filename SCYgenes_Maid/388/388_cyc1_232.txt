two dimension nmr as probe of structur similar to mutant of cytochrome | us site mutagenesi | it is possibl to prepar mani mutant of protein in short time | and to uncov differ in function | to understand the chang in function | it is essenti to understand the effect | of the mutat in term of structur and dynamic chang | it is particularli import to establish rapid method for compar the structur of the mutant with that of the wild type protein | we propos that combin of overlai and differ two dimension noe spectra between the wild type and mutant protein provid rapid method for determin of structur similar | the observ of differ other than those due directli to the field effect of the exchang side chain allow both local and distant conform chang to be assess | here we compar noesi spectra from mutant of yeast iso ferrocytochrom in which the invari phe ha been to tyr | we conclud that nmr can show subtl chang in protein structur | specif | we show the chang must involv the reorient of the side chain of leu which is proxim to the mutat | the dynamic of the aromat side chain at posit ar shown not to give rise to measur differ between the wild type and mutant protein | structur chang ar not propag to measur degre in other part of the protein |
