hydrogen exchang behavior of | u n | and iso cytochrome | heteronuclear nmr spectroscopi to measur the hydrogen deuterium exchang rate of backbon amid hydrogen in both and | u n | iso cytochrome from the yeast saccharomyc | the exchang data confirm previous data | marmorino et al | protein sci | resolv sever inconsist | and provid more thorough coverag of exchang rate throughout the cytochrome protein in both oxid state | combin the data previous collect on unlabel ct with the current data collect on | u n | ct | exchang rate for proton in the state and proton in the state can now be | most significantli | hydrogen exchang measur on | u n | iso cytochrome the observ of exchang behavior of the secondari structur | such as larg loop | that ar not extens hydrogen | for the helic | the most slowli exchang proton ar in the middl of the helix | with more rapidli exchang proton at the helix end | the observ for the omega loop in cytochrome is just the opposit | in the loop | the end contain the most slowli exchang proton and the loop middl allow more rapid exchang | thi is to be true in cytochrome loop | even though the loop end ar not attach to ani regular secondari structur | some of the exchang data ar strikingli inconsist with data collect on the cs variant at differ ph | which suggest ph depend dynamic differ in the protein structur | thi new hydrogen exchang data for loop residu could have implic for the substructur model of eukaryot cytochrome fold | isotop label of variant form of cytochrome can now be to answer mani question about the structur and fold of thi model protein |
