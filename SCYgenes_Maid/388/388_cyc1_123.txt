the role of intern water molecul and it associ hydrogen bond network in cytochrome | high resolut three dimension structur for the ni and ni yf yeast iso cytochrome variant have been in both oxid state | the most promin structur differ in both mutant protein is the displac of | intern water molecul | wat | from the protein matrix | in wild type yeast iso cytochrome the posit and orient of thi water molecul is to be depend on the oxid state of the heme iron atom | overal our result suggest the function of wat and it associ hydrogen bond network is threefold | first | the presenc of wat provid conveni mechan to modifi the hydrogen bond network involv sever residu near the ligand in an oxid state depend manner | second | wat is necessari for the mainten of the spatial relationship between nearbi side chain and the hydrogen bond interact between these group in thi region of the protein | an essenti part of thi role is ensur the proper conform of the side chain of tyr so that it form hydrogen bond interact with the heme ligand | thi hydrogen bond influenc the electron withdraw power of the ligand and is therefor factor in control the midpoint reduct potenti of cytochrome | elimin of thi interact in the ni yf mutant protein or elimin of wat in the ni protein with the subsequ disrupt in the posit and interact of the tyr side chain | lead to drop of approxim mv in the midpoint reduct potenti of the heme group | third | wat also appear to mediat increas in the mobil of three nearbi segment of polypeptide chain when cytochrome is in the state | previou studi have these chang mai be to oxid state depend interact between cytochrome and it redox partner | coincid with the absenc of wat | such mobil chang ar not in the ni and ni yf mutant protein | it is possibl that much of the protein stabil for both mutant protein mai be due to thi factor | final | our result show that neither heme iron charg nor heme plane distort ar respons for oxid state depend conform chang in the pyrrole propion region | instead | the chang appear to be driven by the chang in conform that the side chain of asn experi as the result of oxid state depend movement of wat |
