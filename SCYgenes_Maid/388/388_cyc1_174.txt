chang in charg of an heme contact doe not caus major chang of conform in cytochrome | the structur of the ala variant of yeast iso cytochrome | in which the previous unchang arg ha been | ha been characteris by nmr | the nmr data indic that the structur of the ala variant is veri similar to that of the wild type protein | in particular | the heme environ and interact of the heme macrocycl ar shown to be | analysi of the chemic shift perturb to the reson of il is shown to be consist with the chang in charg at posit | the onli signific area of conform chang at residu and | close to the site of modif | therefor the redox potenti chang accompani the modif | biochemistri | appear to be direct consequ of the side chain of and not result of secondari conform chang by the modif |
