substitut of prolin in yeast iso cytochrome | analysi of residu compat and incompat with fold requir | fine structur genet map previous numer nonfunct cyc have alter at or near the site correspond to amino acid posit of iso cytochrome from the yeast saccharomyc | dna sequenc of the alter in four of these cyc that the normal pro by leu | revert contain at least partial function iso cytochrome | and the alter by dna sequenc and protein analysi | specif activ of the iso cytochrome estim in vivo by growth of the strain in lactat medium | to normal iso cytochrome with pro | the follow activ associ with the follow | approxim | for val | approxim | for thr | approxim | for ser | approxim | for il | and | for leu | in order to develop an understand of the factor that determin whether or not an iso cytochrome will function | we theoret analysi which to the conclus that the activ of the protein depend on both short and long rang interact | short rang interact estim from studi on known protein structur which the likelihood that variou amino acid would be in local backbon configur similar to the nativ protein | long rang interact with the rest of the molecul by consid the size of the side chain | we believ thi approach can be to analyz wide varieti of mutant protein |
