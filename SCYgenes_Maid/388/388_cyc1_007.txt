molecular character of mrg of saccharomyc | implic in the regul of galactos and nonferment carbon sourc util | we have previous that multipl copi of mrg gal gene in wild type but not in gal strain of saccharomyc | in thi report we show that disrupt of mrg lead to decreas in gal induct when | is with | but not with | galactos | disrupt of mrg in gal background | thi strain show long term adapt phenotyp | further delai the gal induct | support the notion that it function is import onli under low induc signal | as corollari | disrupt of mrg in gal strain not decreas the constitut express of gal gene | these result suggest that mrg ha role in gal regul onli when the induct signal is weak | unlik the effect on gal gene express | disrupt of mrg lead to de repress of cyc driven beta galactosidas activ | mrg disrupt also twofold increas in the rate of oxygen uptak as with the wild type strain | adh | cta | dld | and cyc promot that ar activ dure nonfer growth not show ani de repress of beta galactosidas activ in the mrg disrupt | western analysi that mrg is glucos repress gene and is in galactos and glycerol plu lactat | experi us green fluoresc protein fusion construct indic that mrgp is in the nucleu consist with the presenc of consensu nuclear local signal sequenc | base on the abov result | we propos that mrgp is regul of galactos and nonferment carbon util |
