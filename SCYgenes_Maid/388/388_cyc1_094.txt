degrad of cytochrome oxidas subunit in mutant of yeast lack cytochrome and suppress of the degrad by mutat of yme | we have by spectral analysi that cytochrome oxidas is not present in strain of the yeast saccharomyc have primari defici in cytochrome | and we have by immunolog procedur that such strain lack the mitochondri subunit i | ii | and iii of cytochrome oxidas | furthermor | puls chase experi that subunit ii is rapidli in vivo | thi degrad can be at least partial by disrupt of the nuclear gene yme | which encod put atp zn | depend proteas | we suggest that the cytochrome oxidas subunit ar not properli assembl in the absenc of cytochrome | and that yme and possibl other proteas the unassembl mitochondri subunit of cytochrome oxidas |
