us of yeast transform by oligonucleotid to studi dna lesion in vivo | we have mutagen specif of dna lesion in vivo in yeast cyc oligonucleotid transform assai | we two lesion into oligonucleotid | on nucleosid analog | dihydro h | h pyrimido | oxazin on | deoxyriboside | dp | which is highli mutagen to bacteria | it is suppos to be miscod | but otherwis good templat for dna polymerase | the other lesion the tt pyrimidine | pyrimidone photoproduct | on of the typical uv lesion | which block dna replic | these oligonucleotid to transform yeast cyc mutant with ochr nonsens mutat to cyc | as expect from it templat properti in vitro | the transform activ of dp contain oligonucleotid similar to those of unmodifi oligonucleotid | result that dp mai direct incorpor of guanin and adenin at ratio of | or more in vivo | an oligonucleotid contain the photoproduct the transform activ of as low as | of that of the correspond unmodifi oligonucleotid | thi absolut rev gene | the sequenc analysi of the transform ha shown that the lesion read as tt and tc at ratio of | indic it high mutagen potenti |
