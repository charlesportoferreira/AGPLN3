in target dna element of yeast modul it transcript activ without affect dna bind | the yeast zinc cluster protein | member of the gal famili | is transcript activ that bind as homodim to target dna sequenc | these target includ the upstream activ sequenc of the cyc and cyc gene | which have no obviou sequenc similar | even though both site have the same affin for | activ differ at these two site | even when the sequenc ar in an ident promot context | in addit | mutant of that can bind to both site but ar specif transcription inact at cyc have been previous | in order to identifi nucleotid that ar respons for thi differenti activ | we have random and site mutagenesi of these target site and their bind to in vitro and their activ in vivo in report plasmid | our result show that bind site ar degener form of the direct repeat cgg n ta n cgg n ta | moreov | we show that activ of mutant defect for activ of the cycgene is by specif in the cyc bind site | convers | other of the target site prevent activ by | without interf with dna bind | the result suggest that the sequenc of the target site influenc the conform and | henc | the activ of dna |
