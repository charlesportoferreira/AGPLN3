express of yeast gene can be by insert of short yeast dna fragment between ua and the tata box | we have | pov | which facilit the introduct of put upstream activ sequenc | ua | or upstream repress sequenc | ur | from yeast gene into plasmid contain cycl lacz fusion | we have that the insert of yeast sequenc from to bp between the ua and the tata box of cycl lacz fusion gene can block beta galactosidas express | it is that thi block is to the format of nucleosom on the dna |
