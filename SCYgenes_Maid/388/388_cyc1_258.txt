evolut of cytochrome gene and pseudogen | statist analysi of the nucleotid sequenc of cytochrome gene from four speci of anim and two of yeast and of cytochrome pseudogen from rat | mous | and human conduct | it estim that anim and yeast | billion year ago | that the two gene dc and dc in drosophila million year ago | and that the two gene iso and iso in the yeast saccharomyc million year ago | dc is at low level and ha time faster than dc | thi observ support the neutralist view that relax of function constraint is more like caus of acceler evolut follow gene duplic than is advantag mutat | all the rodent pseudogen appear to be pseudogen directli from the function gene | and most of them appar after the mous rat split | no event of gene convers could be between ani pair of the rodent pseudogen | our analysi suggest that the human cytochrome gene ha at rate compar to the averag rate for pseudogen | wherea some human cytochrome pseudogen have at an exception low rate |
