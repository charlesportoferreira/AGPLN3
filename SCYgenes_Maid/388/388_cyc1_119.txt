character of the guanidin hydrochloride state of iso cytochrome by spectroscopi | spectroscopi ha been to monitor residu order structur in the state of wild type and two mutant of iso cytochrome | the techniqu involv care digit subtract procedur that remov spectral contribut from buffer | water vapor | and the denatur guanidin hydrochloride | reliabl and reproduc spectra can be us these method | the data for iso cytochrome show upon denatur shift of the structur sensit amid i band awai from the spectral region associ with random structur | second deriv resolut enhanc of the amid i absorpt band uncov sever band which can be associ with variou residu order structur in the state | gradual chang in the amid i band after denatur ar also as the guanidin hydrochloride concentr is | two singl site mutant of iso cytochrome | which have been shown to have more compact state than the wild type protein | state spectra with signific differ from the wild type protein spectra | these observ provid new insight into the characterist of protein state |
