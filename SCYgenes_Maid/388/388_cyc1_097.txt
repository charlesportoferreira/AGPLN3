yeast phylogenetic relationship base on cytochrome sequenc | the avail of the kicyc sequenc to establish homolog with other cytochrome gene from yeast and the fungu neurospora | in term of nucleotid composit | the cytochrome gene from kluyveromyce higher homolog with schwanniomyc occidentali than with saccharomyc | and thi point is discuss in regard to the differ in the codon usag of these yeast | the amino acid composit of the protein comparison of it sequenc with other cytochrome protein sequenc and new assign of phylogenetic relationship | in thi context kluyveromyce most close to candida krusei |
