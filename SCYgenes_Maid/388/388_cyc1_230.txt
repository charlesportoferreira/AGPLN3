effect of amino acid in yeast iso cytochrome on heme access and intracomplex electron transfer in complex with cytochrome peroxidas | the kinet of reduct of wild type and sever site specif mutant of yeast iso cytochrome | arg il | gln ser | gln ly | ly gln | ly asp | both free and in | complex with yeast cytochrome peroxidas | by free flavin semiquinon have been | intramolecular on electron transfer from the ferrou cytochrome to the ho peroxidas at both low | mm | and high | mm | ionic strength also | the access of the cytochrome heme within the electrostat complex and the rate constant for intramolecular electron transfer at both low and high ionic strength ar highli depend on the specif amino acid present at the protein protein interfac | importantli | replac by uncharg amino acid of arg or ly residu to be import in orient and | or stabil of the electron transfer complex in rate of electron transfer | in all case | an increas in ionic strength from to mm also intramolecular electron transfer rate constant | the result suggest that the electrostat | complex is not optim for electron transfer and that by neutral of kei posit residu | or by an increas in the ionic strength therebi mask the ionic interact | the two protein can orient themselv to allow the format of more effici electron transfer complex |
