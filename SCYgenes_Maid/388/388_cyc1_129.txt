electron transfer in cytochrome depend upon the structur of the interven medium | background | long distanc electron transfer | et | reaction through protein ar in great mani biochem process | howev | the wai in which the protein structur influenc the rate of these reaction is not well understood | we have therefor the rate of intramolecular et from the ferrohem to bi | bipyridine | imidazoleruthenium | iii | acceptor at histidin or in deriv of yeast iso cytochrome | and the effect of an asparagin to isoleucin mutat at posit | situat between the heme and the electron acceptor | result | the fe | ru | rate constant demonstr that affect et from the heme to hi | il | asn | but not to hi | il asn | the fe | ru | hi | electron coupl for the ni | kh protein is in good agreement with sigma tunnel calcul | which predict the length of the et pathwai between the heme and hi | conclus | the structur of the interven medium between the heme and electron acceptor at the protein surfac influenc the donor acceptor coupl in cytochrome |
