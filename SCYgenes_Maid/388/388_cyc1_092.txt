unusu effect of an engin disulfid on global and local protein stabil | the global and local stabil of eukaryot ferricytochrom variant with an engin disulfid ar | the disulfid connect posit | which is usual valin | to posit | which is usual threonin | the cross variant is approxim | kcal mol less stabl than the wild type protein at k | ph | in ho and do | circular dichroism studi show that the stabil result from structur stabil of the state | betz | f | amp | pielak | g | j | biochemistri | here | we us proton chemic shift | paramagnet shift | and amid proton exchang data to obtain atom level structur and energet inform | chemic and paramagnet shift data indic onli minor nativ state structur chang | local stabil is from amid proton deuterium exchang data | us model peptid intrins exchang rate | as expect | the exchang data indic that cross link incorpor decreas the major of local stabil | near the cross link | howev | local stabil seem to increas despit the overal global stabil decreas | furthermor | local stabil chang for hydrophobic core residu seem to be greater than the global stabil chang | we interpret these observ as cross link chang in exchang compet state and relat them to chang in the state |
