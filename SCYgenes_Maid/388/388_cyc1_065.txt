some dna target of the yeast cyp transcript activ ar function asymmetric evid of two half site with differ affin | cyp protein is yeast transcript regul which contain zinc cluster in it dna bind domain | it recent shown by select random cyp bind site that cyp protein recogn with higher affin target contain the cggnnntancgg consensu sequenc | notabl | thi ideal sequenc is howev not in wild type cyp target site | in order to investig how cyp protein actual bind to it target | in three of them | ua | cyc | ua | cyb | ua | cyc | and the consequ toward the bind of cyp | peptid | our data support the follow conclus | when the sequenc element contain two cgg and no ta | both cgg ar essenti for bind | if the sequenc element contain onli the right cgg and the ta | both ar suffici but indispens for the bind of cyp | when two cgc and the ta ar present | the right cgc | and not the on | is essenti for the bind of cyp | d | cyp | peptid is usual monom in solut but bind dna as dimer | final | we evid for the presenc of two half site with differ affin in the asymmetric sequenc of some cyp target |
