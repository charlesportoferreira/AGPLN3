amid proton exchang rate of and saccharomyc iso cytochrome | proton nmr spectroscopi to determin the rate constant | kob | for exchang of labil proton in both | fe | iii | and | fe | ii | iso cytochrome | we find that slowli exchang backbon amid proton tend to lack solvent access surfac area | possess backbon hydrogen bond | and ar present in region of regular secondari structur as well as in omega loop | furthermor | there is no correl between kob and the distanc from backbon amid nitrogen to the nearest solvent access atom | these observ ar consist with the local unfold model | comparison of the free energi chang for denatur | delta gd | at k to the free energi chang for local unfold | delta gop | at k for the protein suggest that certain conform possess higher free energi than the state ar at equilibrium | reduct of the protein result in gener increas in delta gop | comparison of delta gd to delta gop for the protein show that the most open state of the protein possess more structur than it chemic form | thi persist structur in high energi conform of the form appear to involv the axial coordin heme |
