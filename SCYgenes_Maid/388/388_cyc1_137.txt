reson raman studi of the interact between cytochrome variant and cytochrome oxidas | the structur chang in yeast iso cytochrome and fulli bovin cytochrome oxidas that ar upon complex format have been by reson raman spectroscopi | the main spectral chang could be ascrib to cytochrome | which in the case of the wild type protein ar essenti the same as previous in the complex of hors heart cytochrome and bovin cytochrome oxidas | hildebrandt et al | biochemistri | these spectral chang ar attribut to the format of the conform state ii | approxim | which exhibit an open heme pocket structur | the structur chang ar assum to be by the electrostat interact between the neg bind domain on cytochrome oxidas and the posit lysine residu on the front surfac of cytochrome | substitut on of these lysine residu | i | e | ly | by an alanin significantli the state ii content | lt | impli that thi lysine is essenti for control the conform equilibrium of the protein | on the other hand | the replac of lysine by alanin onli slightli the state ii content | approxim | howev | the analysi of the spectra suggest that lysine mai be in control conform detail within the heme pocket of the cytochrome | due to the underli structur chang and the redox potenti | format of state ii mai be of function import for the physiological electron transfer process by lower the reorgan energi and increas the drive forc | the spectral chang by complex format that ar attribut to cytochrome oxidas indic structur chang of the vinyl and formyl substitu while the ground state conform of the porphyrin macrocycl ar | thi find impli that the conform chang in the heme pocket of cytochrome oxidas ar much smaller than those in cytochrome | these chang refer not onli to heme but also to heme | remot from the cytochrome bind site | point to long rang structur commun between the bind domain and the oxygen reduct site | the possibl function implic of these structur chang ar discuss |
