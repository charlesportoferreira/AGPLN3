histidin variant of yeast iso cytochrome that strongli affect the energet of the state | iso cytochrome ha been engin to remov all histidin residu not in heme ligat in the nativ state to produc variant tm | singl histidin residu then at posit | tm | hi | and | tm | hi | sinc histidin residu not in nativ state heme ligat ar known to replac the methionin heme ligand in cytochrome | these variant expect to affect the structur of the state | guanidin hydrochloride denatur to assess the stabil of these protein rel to the wild type protein | the free energi differ for heme ligat in the state assess by ph titrat | the experiment mutat chang | delta deltag | d state | in the free energi of heme ligat for tm | hi versu tm | hi is | kcal | mol | the expect mutat chang in delta deltag | d state | for random coil state is | kcal | mol | thu | tm | hi ha residu structur stabil it state by | kcal | mol rel to tm | hi | the result impli that the state can contribut significantli to mutat chang in the free energi of unfold of protein |
