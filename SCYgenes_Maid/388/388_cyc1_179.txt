comparison of and yeast iso cytochrome us proton paramagnet shift | dipolar paramagnet shift for proton of yeast iso cytochrome have been by us an optim g tensor and the x rai crystallographic coordin of the form of yeast iso cytochrome | louie | g | v | amp | brayer | g | d | j | mol | biol | the valu ar with the paramagnet shift from over nonequival proton that have been assign in both oxid state | gao | y | boyd | j | william | r | j | amp | pielak | g | j | biochemistri | there is good agreement between the and the experiment data with few except | thi indic that | overal | the solut structur must be veri similar in both the and state in solut as is the case in crystal | the differ between and shift valu for the molecul in solut ar most readili explain by slight movement of the heme and certain chang in diamagnet shift due to small rearrang of few residu and some consider chang in few hydrogen bond | it is also known that small differ exist between the structur of the two oxid state in crystal but the hydrogen bond chang ar not so easili there | structur chang from nuclear magnet reson data ar in reason agreement with those from crystallographi | but addit inform is clearli avail concern chang in hydrogen bond |
