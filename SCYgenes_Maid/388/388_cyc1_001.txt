backbon dynamic and hydrogen exchang of pseudomona aeruginosa ferricytochrom | model free analysi of pseudomona aeruginosa ferricytochrom | dynamic base on | n r | n r | and | h | n heteronuclear nuclear overhaus effect data is | the protein backbon is highli rigid | lt | and displai littl variat in picosecond nanosecond time scale dynamic over the structur | the loop structur contain the axial methionin ligand | loop | displai anomal rigid | which is attribut to it high prolin content | also ar protect factor from hydrogen exchang rate | these data reveal that loop residu | includ the axial methionin | ar from exchang as result of long rang hydrogen bond interact | these result ar contrast with data for saccharomyc iso ferricytochrom | which displai higher overal flexibl | lt | greater variat of dynamic as function of structur | and low protect factor for loop | thi analysi reveal that heme protein with similar function and topolog mai displai divers dynamical properti |
