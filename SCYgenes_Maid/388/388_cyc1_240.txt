function character of pyrimidine rich element in the | noncod region of the yeast iso cytochrome gene | predominantli pyrimidine rich sequenc | purin in the templat strand | of base | is between function tata element and the correspond transcript start site region of the saccharomyc iso cytochrome | cyc | gene | by us linker delet and gene fusion techniqu | the function characterist of thi pyrimidine sequenc | result indic that the function of thi element is to limit the accumul of full length mrna with | end which map upstream of the pyrimidine rich sequenc | data suggest that the | noncod region of the cyc gene possess signal for mrna | end process |
