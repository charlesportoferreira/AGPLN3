ration design of more stabl yeast iso cytochrome | yeast iso cytochrome is on of the least stabl mitochondri cytochrome | we have coordin approach | combin the known function and structur properti of cytochrome | to engin into yeast iso cytochrome with the goal of select increas the stabil of the protein | the two redox form of the nativ protein and six differ mutant form of yeast iso cytochrome by differenti scan calorimetri | dsc | the rel stabil | as the differ in the gibb | free energi of denatur at given temperatur between the nativ and mutant form | deltadeltag | tref | for each of the protein | in both oxid state | the mutant protein ct | te | ct | ta | ct | and te | ta | ct more stabl than the wild type protein | respect | the stabil of the mutant protein is to be due to the remov of rare surfac cysteine and the stabil of two distort alpha helic |
