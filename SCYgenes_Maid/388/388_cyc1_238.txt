role of phenylalanine in yeast iso cytochrome and remot conform chang by serin at thi posit | three dimension structur analysi of the form of the ser mutant protein of yeast iso cytochrome ha been to | resolut | replac of phe with serin result in conform chang both near and remot from the mutat site | those group undergo posit shift near ser includ arg | gly and | and the cbb methyl of the heme group | remot shift ar center about the propion of pyrrole ring and princip involv asn | trp | and an intern buri water molecul | wat | placement of serin side chain at posit also lead to the format of larg solvent channel which substanti increas the solvent access of the heme group | thi would appear to account for the much lower reduct potenti for thi protein | the detriment effect of ser on both the steadi state activ and the rate of electron transfer in complex with cytochrome peroxidas can also be in term of the modifi charact of the region about the mutat site | the remot conform chang appear to repres the equival of the initi conform chang occur as yeast iso cytochrome is to the fulli state dure an electron transfer event | these result agre well with the propos | moor | g | r | feb lett | that the trigger for conform chang between oxid state resid in the natur of the interact between the heme iron atom and the pyrrole ring propion group |
