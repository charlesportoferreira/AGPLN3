the rox gene encod an essenti nuclear protein in cyc gene express in saccharomyc | the rox gene dure hunt for mutant with express of the heme cyc gene | which encod the minor speci of cytochrome in the yeast saccharomyc | the rox mutant fold increas in cyc express both in the presenc and absenc of heme | slightli anaerob express of the heme cyc gene | and decreas in the anaerob express of the heme anb gene and the aerob express of it heme homolog | the wild type rox gene | and the sequenc that it encod amino acid protein | thi protein is essenti | delet of the code sequenc lethal | the code sequenc for beta galactosidas to the | end of the rox code sequenc | and the fusion product to be in the nucleu | strongli suggest that the wild type protein carri out nuclear function | in the rox gene an interest pattern of intragen complement | delet of the | code region nonsens mutat at codon but could not prevent the lethal of the null mutat | these result suggest that the amino termin domain is for an essenti function | while the carboxi termin domain can be suppli in tran to achiev the wild type express of cyc | final | rna blot that the rox mrna at higher level anaerob but not subject to heme repress | the nuclear local and the lack of viabil of null mutant suggest that the rox protein is gener regulatori factor |
