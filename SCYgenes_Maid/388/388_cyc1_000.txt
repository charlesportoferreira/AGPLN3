independ function of yeast pcfp in pre mrna | end process and in transcript termin | pcfp | an essenti subunit of the yeast cleavag factor ia | is for pre mrna | end process | bind to the termin domain | ctd | of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii | rnap ii | and is in transcript termin | we show that the ctd interact domain | cid | of pcfp is essenti for cell viabil | interestingli | the ctd bind and | end process activ of pcfp can be function uncoupl from each other and by distinct pcfp fragment in tran | impair ctd bind not affect the | end process activ of pcfp and defici of pcfp in | end process not prevent ctd bind | transcript run on analysi with the cyc gene that loss of cleavag activ not correl with defect in transcript termin | wherea loss of ctd bind | we conclud that pcfp is bifunct protein and that transcript cleavag is not an obligatori step prior to rnap ii termin |
