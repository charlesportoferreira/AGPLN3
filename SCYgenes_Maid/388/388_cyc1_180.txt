proton nuclear magnet reson as probe of differ in structur between the ct and fs | ct variant of iso cytochrome from the yeast saccharomyc | differ in chemic shift and in nuclear overhaus effect between the ct and fs | ct variant of saccharomyc iso cytochrome in both the and form ar and | there is evid for small conform differ in both oxid state of the doubl variant near posit | differ in structur ar more evid in the form of the variant | these differ extend to distant part of the protein | it is that the doubl variant ha undergon small rearrang of sever region of the protein that ar by hydrogen bond network | it is shown that the rearrang involv hydrogen bond associ with the two heme propion and associ water molecul | the deduct from nuclear magnet reson data ar with the differ in the crystal structur of the form of wild type protein and the fs variant | louie | g | v | pielak | g | j | smith | m | amp | brayer | g | d | biochemistri |
