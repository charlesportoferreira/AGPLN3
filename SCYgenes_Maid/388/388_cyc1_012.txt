the clone and character of the cdc gene famili in saccharomyc | we have gene that the cold sensit growth of cdc mutant strain of saccharomyc at degre | the cdc gene to be ident to ycrw on chromosom iii and contain nucleotid encod amino acid | we missens mutat at the first initi codon of cdc | the disrupt of the cdc gene that it is not essenti for growth | but the disrupt the same cold sensit phenotyp as cdc | suggest that the cdc is null mutat from the mutat in the first codon | the cdc mutant arrest at start in g phase at the non permiss temperatur | the cdc gene product ha strong structur similar to two other protein in saccharomyc by ynrw and ynlw | the over express of either ynrw or ynlw the cdc mutant and the doubl disrupt of either cdc and ynrw or cdc and ynlw in sever slow growth phenotyp | we conclud that these three gene constitut famili with redund function | we also that the cdc gene multicopi suppressor of cdc mutat | suggest that the cdc famili is in regul of transcript via cdc |
