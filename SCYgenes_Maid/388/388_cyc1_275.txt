mutat allow an mrna secondari structur diminish translat of saccharomyc iso cytochrome | the cyc o mutat in the yeast saccharomyc produc hi leu replac of the normal ala gly sequenc at amino acid posit and | which lie within dispens region of iso cytochrome | thi mutat can accommod the format of hairpin structur at the correspond site in the mrna | the amount of the protein to | of the wild type level | wherea the amount of the mrna normal | howev | in contrast to the normal cyc | mrna that is associ mainli with four to seven ribosom | the bulk of the cyc o mrna is associ with on to four ribosom | these result suggest that the stabl secondari structur within the translat region of the cyc mrna diminish translat by inhibit elong |
