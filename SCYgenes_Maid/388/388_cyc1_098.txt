structur studi of the role of residu and at the interact face of cytochrome | combin of structur | function | and mutagen experi ha been to studi the role of the invari phe and highli leu residu in cytochrome | especi with respect to the complex interfac with electron transfer partner and mainten of the hydrophobic heme pocket | structur analys show that the fy | la | and fy | la mutant protein all retain the characterist cytochrome fold | but that conform alter ar in the direct vicin of the mutat site | in particular | the addit hydroxyl group of tyr is in direct spatial conflict with the side chain of leu in the fy mutant protein | lead to rotat of the side chain of tyr out toward the protein surfac | thi strain is in the fy | la mutant protein where the phenyl ring of tyr is accommod in conform compar to that of the phenylalanine normal present at thi locat | in addit | the avail space vacat by the replac of leu with an alanin allow for the inclus of two new intern water molecul | on of which is to tyr and the other to arg | in contrast | in the la mutant protein | no intern water molecul ar in thi exclus hydrophobic pocket | which is partial fill by shift in nearbi side chain | overal | the conform chang result from the optim of side chain pack to reflect the spatial requir of new side chain | the minim of both vacant intern space and the solvent exposur of hydrophobic group | and the attain of maxim hydrogen bond between avail polar group | abstract at word |
