refold disulfid dimer of cytochrome | coval dimer of saccharomyc iso cytochrome is by an interchain disulfid bond involv the cysteine penultim to the terminu | the individu chain in the dimer appear to retain the tertiari structur featur characterist for monomer cytochrome albeit with some perturb | the dimer is revers by heat | urea | or guanidin hydrochloride in singl cooper transit whose midpoint is less than that of the monomer protein | the kinet profil for the refold of the dimer is characterist for monomer cytochrome except for markedli slow phase amplitud |
