analysi of the structur and stabil of omega loop in yeast iso cytochrome | omega | omega | loop | residu in wild type yeast iso cytochrome | ha been and with loop sequenc from three other cytochrome and on from esteras | yeast express partial loop delet do not contain percept amount of holoprotein as by low temperatur spectroscopi and cannot grow on nonferment media | strain express loop replac accumul holoprotein in vivo | but the protein function vari depend on the sequenc and length of the replac loop | in vivo express level do not correl with their thermal denatur temperatur | in vitro spectroscop studi of the loop replac protein indic that all fold into nativ like cytochrome conform | but ar less stabl than the wild type protein | decreas in thermal stabil ar by perturb of loop backbon in on case and slight reorgan of the protein hydrophobic core in anoth case | rather than rearrang of the loop backbon | singl site mutat in on of the replac mutant to reliev ineffici hydrophobic core pack by the new loop recov some | but not all | of the stabil |
