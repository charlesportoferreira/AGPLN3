yeast protein with homolog to the beta subunit of g protein is in control of heme and catabolit gene | the product of the saccharomyc aer gene is respons for maintain repress of at least two distinct regulatori pathwai | heme activ | repress and catabolit repress | in the gene an eightfold increas in the express of the heme cyc gene in the absenc of heme | substanti increas in the express of the heme anb gene in the presenc of heme | and fold increas in the express of the catabolit gal gene in the presenc of glucos | lesser or no increas in the express of these gene under or activ condit | the aer also larg increas in cyc gene express under all condit | thi gene is subject to heme activ | repress | as well as catabolit repress | the aer gene and the sequenc | the larg open read frame contigu with the transcript from the complement region amino acid polypeptide chain with extens homolog to the beta subunit of g protein | the sequenc that aer is the tup gene | delet mutat and the null phenotyp the same as the origin mutant | the aer null mutant shown to have aerob and anaerob level of rna encod the rox repressor | normal onli aerob and respons for the aerob repress of anb express | the increas in both rox and anb rna aerob in thi mutant suggest that the repressor is nonfunct in the mutant |
