multipl base pair in yeast | the nucleotid chang associ with both forward and revers at the cyc in the yeast saccharomyc have been by sequenc the gene product | iso cytochrome and | more directli | by sequenc appropri dna segment | although the major of these ar the result of singl base pair chang | approxim | ar the result of multipl and these occur predominantli at certain site and with certain pattern | most multipl base pair chang occur within nucleotid of each other and ar gener within six nucleotid | on the basi of the frequenc and pattern of | these nucleotid chang ar consid to have as singl | concert event | rather than as multipl independ | analysi of these indic that multipl base pair chang can aris by wide differ mechan | we have the follow class of | multipl base pair chang that yield | direct repeat or | invert repeat of local dna sequenc | substitut of two tandem base pair | frameshift and contigu singl base pair substitut | and | recombin of the cyc gene with non allel gene | result in alter within contigu segment that can be over nucleotid in length | some of the multipl base pair chang do not fall into ani of these categori | we suggest mechan to account for each of these five class |
