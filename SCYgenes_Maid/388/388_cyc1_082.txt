differenti ubiquitin depend degrad of the yeast apo cytochrome isozym | the yeast saccharomyc contain two form of cytochrome | iso and iso cytochrome | which ar by the nuclear gene cyc and cyc | respect | the cytochrome ar in the cytosol | import into mitochondria | and subsequ modifi by the coval attach of heme through the action of cytochrome heme lyase | which is by cyc | apo iso cytochrome but not apo iso cytochrome in cyc | mutant | furthermor | puls chase experi previous that the lack of apo iso cytochrome due to it rapid degrad | we report herein that thi degrad of apo iso cytochrome is depend on ubiquitin and on the action of the proteasom | degrad of apo iso cytochrome in pre and pre mutant have proteasom subunit | in ubc | ubc | and ubc strain lack on or more of the ubiquitin conjug enzyme | and in strain in multi ubiquitin by overproduct of the abnorm ubiquitin kr ubiquitin | in addit | we have epitop tag ubiquitin to demonstr that apo iso cytochrome but not apo iso cytochrome is ubiquitin | furthermor | the degrad of apo iso cytochrome when the n termin region with the n termin region of apo iso cytochrome | indic that thi region mai be the target for degrad | we suggest that ubiquitin depend degrad of apo iso cytochrome is part of the regulatori process control the preferenti express of the iso cytochrome |
