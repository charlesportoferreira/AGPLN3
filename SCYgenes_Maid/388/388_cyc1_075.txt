the polar of tyrosine in yeast iso cytochrome by second deriv spectroscopi | the averag tyrosine polar of yeast iso cytochrome protein and two hors heart cytochrome protein by second deriv spectroscopi | yeast iso cytochrome contain five tyrosine | on of which | tyrosine | is in the heme pocket | the wild type protein and the yf | nv yf | and n yf protein to differenti event that occur in or near the heme pocket from those occur closer to the protein | surfac | the wild type protein show substanti chang in the second deriv spectrum as the protein goe from to | mutant lack tyrosine do not show thi chang | thi indic that it is primarili the spectrum of tyrosine that chang as the protein cycle between the and state | on thing that contribut to the overal polar of the heme pocket is water molecul hydrogen to sever of the nearbi residu | the wild type protein ha on water molecul in the heme pocket but thi can be or by introduc into the protein | na ha two water molecul and ni ha no water molecul in the pocket | the three protein us to assess the contribut of water to the heme crevic polar | the number of water molecul in the crevic correl with the perceiv polar of the pocket when on take account of the fact that the second water molecul in the crevic of the na mutant take the posit and hydrogen bond pattern of the amid it replac |
