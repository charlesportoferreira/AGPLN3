intern delet in the yeast transcript activ have opposit effect at two sequenc element | in thi report we studi the effect of intern delet of the yeast transcript activ | cyp | on activ at two dissimilar dna bind site | upstream activ sequenc | ua | of cyc | iso cytochrome | and cyc | iso cytochrome | these delet remov up to amino acid of the protein and bring the carboxyl termin acid activ domain closer to the amino termin dna bind domain | surprisingli | the delet have opposit effect at the two site | activ at ua increas with delet size | while activ at cyc decreas | the mutant with the largest delet | mini | ha no measur activ at cyc but bind normal to the site in vitro | in contrast | protein with the dna bind domain of to the acid activ domain of gal is activ at both ua and cyc | these find ar discuss in the context of two model that suggest how the dna sequenc can alter the activ of the | in separ experi | we gener mutat in the dna bind domain of that requir the addit of zinc for bind to either ua or cyc in vitro | thi find show that zinc finger anchor dna bind to both type of site |
