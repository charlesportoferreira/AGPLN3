role of arginin in regul of the cytochrome oxid reduct equilibrium | arg is an intern of mitochondri cytochrome that is close to heme propion | previou work compar the behavior of cytochrome from sever speci | moor | g | r | harri | d | e | leitch | f | amp | pettigrew | g | w | biochim | biophi | acta | ha that arg the pka of thi propion group and therebi account for the rel ph independ of the cytochrome reduct potenti from ph to ph | the influenc of arg on the oxid reduct equilibrium of yeast iso cytochrome ha now been by electrochem | nmr | and theoret analysi of six specif form of thi protein in which arg ha been by ly | hi | gln | asn | leu | or ala | as the electron withdraw charact of the at posit decreas | the reduct potenti of the protein also decreas | with the largest decreas | ca | mv | for the ala variant | howev | the variat in the reduct potenti of the mutant as function of ph similar to that for the wild type protein | the effect of some of these on the pka valu of hi and hi have been by nmr spectroscopi and to be minim | calcul of the electrostat free energi for the leu variant predict decreas in the reduct potenti of thi mutant that is remark close to that experiment | thi work establish that while arg contribut to the rel high reduct potenti of cytochrome | thi doe not appear to be the sole function respons for lower the heme propion pka |
