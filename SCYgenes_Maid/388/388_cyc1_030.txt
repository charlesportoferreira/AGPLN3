the coil coil dimer element of the yeast transcript activ | gal famili member | is dispens for dna bind but differenti affect transcript activ | the heme activ protein is member of the yeast gal famili | which consist of transcript factor with zn | cy | cluster that recogn cgg triplet | mani member of the gal famili contain coil coil dimer element and bind symmetricalli to dna as homodim | howev | possess two uniqu properti | first | bind asymmetric to direct repeat of two cgg triplet | second | bind to two class of dna element | ua | cyc and ua | cyc | and permit differenti transcript activ at these site | here we the residu of the dimer domain critic for dna bind and differenti transcript activ | we that the dimer domain is compos of function redund element that can substitut each other in dna bind and transcript activ | remark | delet of the coil coil dimer element not sever diminish dna bind and transcript activ at ua | cyc but complet transcript activ at ua | cyc | furthermor | ala substitut in the dimer element select transcript activ at ua | cyc | these result strongli suggest that the coil coil dimer element is respons for differenti transcript activ at ua | cyc and ua | cyc and for make contact with put coactiv or part of the transcript machineri |
