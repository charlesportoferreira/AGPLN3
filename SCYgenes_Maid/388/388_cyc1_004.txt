biogenesi of yeast mitochondri cytochrome | uniqu relationship to the tom machineri | the import of cytochrome into the mitochondri intermembran space is not understood at mechanist level | while the precursor apocytochrom can insert into protein free bilayer | the translocas of the outer membran | tom | complex support the transloc of apocytochrom into proteoliposom | we report an in organello analysi of cytochrome import into yeast mitochondria from wild type cell and differ mutant cell | each defect in on of the seven tom protein | the import of cytochrome is not by remov of the receptor tom or tom | moreov | neither the transfer protein tom nor the assembl factor tom and tom ar for import of cytochrome | when the gener import pore | gip | protein tom is | the import of cytochrome is moder | mitochondria lack the central receptor and organ protein tom contain greatli level of cytochrome | we conclud that up to two compon of the tom complex | tom and possibl the gip | ar in the biogenesi of cytochrome |
