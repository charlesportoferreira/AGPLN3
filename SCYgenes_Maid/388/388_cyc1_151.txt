evid for an interact between the cyp | activ and cellular factor dure heme depend transcript regul in the yeast saccharomyc | previous | it shown that the cyp | gene product mediat the transcript of sever oxygen gene through metabol co effector | heme | in the yeast saccharomyc | thi studi investig the overproduct of the cyp protein when the cyp | gene is under the control of the gal cyc hybrid promot | either at the of the cyp | gene or in high copi number | in these condit | the cyp protein is by western analysi and ha molecular mass in agreement with the open read frame sequenc | band shift experi show that the cyp | protein is abl to interact specif with it target sequenc in vitro without addit of hemin | and form larg complex with on or sever unidentifi factor as x | addit of hemin allow the format of new complex which ha lower molecular mass | the intern delet of the seven amino acid sequenc contain the kcpvdh motif in the cyp | protein modifi the heme respons phenomenon in vitro in the band shift experi and in vivo in the transcript of the cyb | cyc | cyp | cyc | and erg gene | on the basi of these data | we propos new model for heme activ of the cyp protein |
