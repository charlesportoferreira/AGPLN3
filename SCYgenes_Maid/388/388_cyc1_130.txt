clone and characteris of the cytochrome gene of aspergillu nidulan | the cytochrome gene | cyca | of the filament fungu aspergillu nidulan ha been and | the gene is present in singl copi per haploid genom and encod polypeptide of amino acid residu | the nucleotid sequenc of the | nidulan cyca gene show | ident to the dna sequenc of the neurospora cytochrome gene | and approxim | ident to the sequenc of the saccharomyc iso cytochrome gene | cyc | the | cyc gene as heterolog probe to isol the gene in | nidulan | the | nidulan cytochrome sequenc contain two small intron | on of these is highli in term of posit | but the other ha not been in ani of the cytochrome gene so far | express of the cyca gene is not by glucos repress | but ha been shown to be approxim tenfold in the presenc of oxygen and three to fourfold under heat shock condit |
