relat between the princip ax of inertia and ligand bind | the princip ax of inertia ar eigenvector that can be for ani rigid bodi | we report studi of the posit of the princip ax in crystallographicalli solv protein molecul | we find with high frequenc that at least on princip axi penetr the surfac of the respect protein in region for ligand bind | in antibodi variabl region | an axi goe through the third hypervariable loop of the heavi chain | in major histocompat complex protein | an axi goe through the peptid bind groov | in protein protein heterodim | princip axi of on subunit will often penetr the interfac with the other subunit | in mani of these protein protein complex | the axi specif intersect residu known to be critic for molecular recognit |
