identif of pre mrna polyadenylate site in saccharomyc | in contrast to higher eukaryot | littl is known about the natur of the sequenc which direct | end format of pre mrna in the yeast saccharomyc | the hexanucleotid aauaaa | which is highli and crucial in mammal | doe not seem to have ani function import for | end format in yeast cell | instead | other element have been to serv as signal sequenc | we detail investig of the yeast act | adh | cyc | and ypt cdna | which that the polyadenylate site in vivo can be scatter over region span up to nucleotid | it therefor seem veri unlik that singl signal sequenc is respons for the select of all these polyadenylate site | our studi also that in the larg major of mrna | polyadenylate start directli befor or after an adenosin and that | end format of adh transcript occur preferenti at the sequenc pyaaa | site mutagenesi of these site in the adh gene that thi pyaaa sequenc is essenti for polyadenylate site select both in vitro and in vivo | furthermor | the | termin region of the yeast gene here ar by their capac to act as signal for | end format in vivo in either orient |
