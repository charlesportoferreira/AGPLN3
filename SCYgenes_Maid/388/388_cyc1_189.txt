contrast mutat rate in mitochondri and nuclear gene of yeast versu mammal | base substitut have been in two mitochondri and two nuclear gene from three yeast and three mammal | in yeast | the two mitochondri gene | cytochrome oxidas subunit | cox | and apocytochrom | cyb | have fewer chang on percentag basi than the nuclear cytochrome | cyc | gene | by contrast | in mammal | the same mitochondri gene have more than cyc on percentag basi | sequenc comparison of the nuclear small subunit ribosom rna | nssu | gene show that there ar more substitut per unit length in the three yeast than in the three mammal | thi result suggest that although the yeast ar more distantli than the mammal | their mitochondri gene have accumul fewer chang |
