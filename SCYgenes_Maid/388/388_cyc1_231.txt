proton nmr studi show that the thr mutant of yeast iso cytochrome is typical member of the eukaryot cytochrome famili | the thr mutant of yeast iso cytochrome is us system for the studi of structur function relationship in thi import class of electron transfer protein | but littl is known about it structur | furthermor | few assign of individu amino acid residu in yeast iso cytochrome have been by proton nmr | here we report assign for nearli half of the amino acid in the thr mutant of yeast iso cytochrome | we also report assign for the thr mutant | while the crystal structur of the iso cytochrome | n | not the thr mutant | ha been | there is current littl structur inform concern it solut structur and none concern the protein | there is also no inform concern the structur of either oxid state of the thr mutant | comparison of the chemic shift and noe data for the thr mutant and comparison of paramagnet shift for analog residu between thi mutant and hors heart and tuna cytochrome reveal that both the basic fold of thr yeast iso cytochrome and the region around the site of the mutat ar the same as those in the latter two protein | it is that the result from structur function studi us the thr mutant will be applic to eukaryot cytochrome in gener | thi knowledg allow us to proce to descript of some mutant of yeast iso cytochrome in the next paper |
