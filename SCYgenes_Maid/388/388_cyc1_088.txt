degrad of cyc mrna in the yeast saccharomyc doe not requir translat | sever studi have that degrad of certain mrna is tightli coupl to their translat | wherea | in contrast | other observ that translat can be without chang the stabil of the mrna | we have address thi question with the us of cyc allel | which iso cytochrome in the yeast saccharomyc | the cyc mrna | which lack all in frame and out of frame aug triplet | as stabl as the normal mrna | thi find that translat is not for the degrad of cyc mrna | furthermor | poli | g | track within the cyc mrna translat region to block exonucleas degrad | the recoveri of | fragment that the translat and the aug defici mrna ar both | also | the stabil of cyc mrna in xrn delta strain lack xrnp | the major | exonucleas | that the normal and aug defici mrna ar by the same pathwai | in addit | deadenylyl | which activ the action of xrnp | at equival rate in both normal and aug defici mrna | we conclud that translat is not for the normal degrad of cyc mrna | and that translat and untransl mrna ar by the same pathwai |
