nmr studi of the structur characterist of variant of yeast iso cytochrome in which aromat residu have been | the structur of variant of yeast iso cytochrome | in which the previous unchang tyr and tyr | trp have been by phe | have been characteris by nmr | the nmr data that the structur of the variant cytochrome ar veri similar to the wild type protein | in particular | the heme environ and interact of the heme macrocycl shown to be | the observ of chemic shift differ have for the assess of conform chang | the substitut of trp by phe mai have small conform chang | manifest of which is the chemic shift differ at hi | val and tyr | the structur basi for the reduct in redox potenti accompani the amino acid substitut is discuss and the propos that the chang in potenti ar direct consequ of the side chain properti and do not result primarili from conform chang |
