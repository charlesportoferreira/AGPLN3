proton nmr comparison of the saccharomyc ferricytochrom isozym monom and coval disulfid dimer | proton nmr studi of saccharomyc | baker yeast | isozym monom and dimer ferricytochrom have been out | the dimer is via disulfid bridg between the cy residu of monom protein | nuclear overhaus effect | noe | experi have to reson assign for mani of the heme and axial ligand | hi | proton in both protein form | reson of the follow amino acid have also been assign in both form | phe | pro | phe | trp | leu | the proton noe connect pattern of the monom of yeast isozym ferricytochrom ar similar to those of hors | tuna | and yeast isozym ferricytochrom | even though the hyperfine reson spectra ar significantli differ for the variou cytochrome | the pattern of dimer proton hyperfine reson is distinct from the isozym monom pattern | which indic that the format of disulfid bridg via cy is at the heme site | approxim distant | it appear that specif structur chang is upon dimer | which | in turn | caus specif perturb in the vicin of the heme | howev | the gener featur of the noe connect pattern in the dimer ar the same as for the monom indic that dimer doe not result in drastic structur disrupt | furthermor | the h nmr spectrum of the dimer can be mimick by the monom form that result when the sh group of cy is chemic modifi with certain type of bulki | or hydrophilic reagent | i | e | dithiobi | nitrobenzo | indic that perturb of the yeast isozym ferricytochrom proton reson spectrum upon dimer ar essenti due to chang in intramolecular | rather than intermolecular | interact | these result suggest that possibl regulatori site for yeast isozym cytochrome exist at posit | which could conceiv have physiological role in alter the conform of the molecul |
