the structur and function of omega loop in cytochrome | the structur and function consequ of replac omega loop | residu | in yeast iso cytochrome with the correspond loop of rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome have been | the three dimension structur of thi loop replac mutant repa cytochrome | and second mutant repa | val | cytochrome in which back to valin | us x rai diffract techniqu | chang in the molecular pack is evid in the repa mutant protein | which ha phenylalanine at posit | consider larger than the valin in wild type yeast iso cytochrome | the side chain of phe is redirect toward the molecular surfac | alter the pack of thi region of omega loop with the hydrophobic core of the protein | in the repa | val | structur | omega loop contain valin at posit | which restor the origin wild type pack arrang of the hydrophobic core | also | as result of omega loop replac | is from histidin to asparagin | which result in displac of the main chain atom near to which is hydrogen | in vivo studi of the growth rate of the mutant strain on nonferment media indic that the repa | val | cytochrome behav much like the wild type yeast iso protein | wherea the stabil and function of the repa cytochrome temperatur depend | the midpoint reduct potenti by cyclic voltammetri of the repa mutant is mv at degre | thi is mv less than the wild type and repa | val | protein | mv | and mai result from disrupt of the hydrophobic pack in the heme pocket and mobil of omega loop in repa cytochrome | the temperatur depend of the reduct potenti is also greatli in the repa protein |
