proton titrat curv of yeast iso ferricytochrom | electrostat and conform effect of point | the proton titrat curv of yeast iso ferricytochrom and point mutant of thi protein have been between ph and at and degre with comput titrat system | initi titrat of the wild type protein to acid ph by subsequ titrat to alkalin and then acid ph demonstr hysteresi | with on more group | titrat between ph and than origin titrat | between ph and | initi titrat to alkalin ph | howev | in observ of the same number of group in both direct of titrat | vs | at degre | fewer group to titrat over the same rang of ph | titrat curv for six cytochrome mutant modifi at arg | phe | tyr | and tyr by subtract of the correspond titrat curv for the wild type protein to produc differ titrat curv | in most case | the effect of these as in the differ titrat curv could be for as either the result of introduct of an addit group titrat within thi ph rang | the result of chang in the pk of titrat | and | or the result of chang in the pk for either the first acid or the first alkalin protein conform transit | in addit to demonstr of the electrostat consequ of the in cytochrome here | thi studi establish the gener us of precis proton titrat curv analysi in the character of variant protein through recombin genet techniqu |
