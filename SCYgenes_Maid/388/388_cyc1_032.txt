cytochrome gfp fusion is not releas from mitochondria into the cytoplasm upon express of bax in yeast cell | to studi bax releas of cytochrome in vivo | we have cytochrome gfp | green fluoresc protein | fusion in saccharomyc cell null for the express of the endogen cytochrome | we show here that cytochrome gfp is effici localis to mitochondria and abl to function as an electron carrier between complex iii and iv of the respiratori chain | strikingli | while natur cytochrome is releas into the cytoplasm upon express of bax | the cytochrome gfp fusion is not | nevertheless | cell co express bax and the cytochrome gfp fusion die | indic that mitochondri releas of cytochrome is not essenti for cell death to occur in yeast | the failur to releas cytochrome gfp is presum to aris from bulk due to the gfp moieti | we propos that in intact yeast cell | bax releas of cytochrome into the cytoplasm occur through select pore and not as consequ of the non specif breakag of the mitochondri outer membran |
