sequenti main chain proton and carbon reson assign for wild type yeast iso ferrocytochrom and identif of secondari structur element | yeast iso cytochrome is natur occur protein that possess an unusu reactiv cy that imbu iso with complic solut chemistri which includ spontan dimer and poorli redox reaction | for thi reason previou studi of thi typical member of the type cytochrome have been releg to variant protein in which the posit ha been | with most common chang involv serin and threonin | howev | we have sequenti h reson assign for the wild type nativ protein becaus it is the actual particip in yeast mitochondri electron transfer process and becaus the wild type nativ protein should be the fundament assign basi | in addit to h reson assign for of amino acid | we have also an extens databas of long rang noe | comparison of these noe and chemic shift index base upon alpha h reson ha lead to identif of solut secondari structur element that ar consist with the solid state crystal structur | although there is current no effici express system that would facilit isotop label of iso cytochrome | we to assess the us of futur heteronuclear experi by us natur abund h | hmqc experi to unambigu assign alpha reson |
