stabil in vivo of thermodynam stabl mutant form of yeast iso cytochrome | previou work ha that the ni amino acid replac in iso cytochrome from the yeast saccharomyc caus an unpreced increas in thermodynam stabil of the protein in vitro | wherea the ng replac diminish stabil | spectrophotometr measur of intact cell that the ni iso cytochrome is present at higher than normal level in vivo | although iso cytochrome turnov is neglig dure aerob growth | transfer of fulli | aerob grown cell to anaerob growth condit lead to reduct in the level of all of the cytochrome | puls chase experi out under these anaerob condit that the ni iso cytochrome ha longer half life than the normal protein | thi is the first report of stabil in vivo of mutant form of protein that ha an thermodynam stabil in vitro | although the ni protein concentr is higher than the normal level | growth in lactat medium that the specif activ of thi iso cytochrome in vivo is rel to wild type | on the other hand | the level of the thermodynam labil ng iso cytochrome below normal | the in vivo level of the ni and ng iso cytochrome suggest that protein in the mitochondri intermembran space can be subject to degrad | and that thi degrad mai plai role in control their normal level |
