introduct of disulfid bond into cytochrome stabil compact state | we novel disulfid bond | model on that of bullfrog cytochrome | into yeast iso cytochrome | the disulfid spontan form upon purif | varieti of techniqu to examin the denatur of thi variant and sever non cross control | denatur is revers and | with the except of the protein in which the two cysteine ar | consist with two state process | comparison of the calorimetr and van | t hoff enthalpi chang indic that denatur is two state at ph | calorimetr and fluoresc guanidin hydrochloride | gdnhcl | denatur data indic that the free energi of denatur for the cross protein | delta gd at k | is rel to non cross control | the depend of delta gd on gdnhcl concentr | the gdnhcl concentr that denatur half the protein | as well as the enthalpi | entropi | and heat capac chang | mgdnhcl | cm | delta hd | delta sd | and delta cp | respect | all decreas in magnitud upon introduct of the cross link | the decreas in delta hd and delta sd by monitor absorb at sever wavelength as function of temperatur | the cross link also decreas the ph depend of these observ | circular dichroism studi indic the state of the cross protein possess more structur than non cross protein | and thi structur is refractori to increas in temperatur and chemic denatur | we conclud that the valu of delta gd | delta hd | delta sd | delta cp | and mgdnhcl result from the state of the cross variant be more compact and possess more structur than non cross control |
