effect of oxygen concentr on the express of cytochrome and cytochrome oxidas gene in yeast | oxygen is an import environment regul for the transcript of sever gene in saccharomyc | but it is not yet clear how thi yeast or other eukaryot actual sens oxygen | to begin to address thi we have the effect of oxygen concentr on the express of sever nuclear gene | cyc | cyc | cox | coxa | coxb | cox | cox | cox | and cox | for protein of the termin portion of the respiratori chain | coxb and cyc ar hypoxic gene | the rest ar aerob gene | we have that the level of express of these gene is by oxygen concentr per se and not mere the presenc or absenc of oxygen and that each of these gene ha low oxygen threshold | microm o | for express | for some aerob gene | cox | coxa | cox | cox | and cox | there is gradual declin in express between microm o | air | and their oxygen threshold | below thi threshold express drop precipit | for other | coxa and cyc | the level of express is nearli constant between microm o and their threshold and then drop off | the hypoxic gene coxb and cyc ar not until the oxygen concentr is below | microm o | these studi have also that coxa and cyc | the gene for the aerob isoform of cytochrome oxidas subunit v and cytochrome | and coxb and cyc | the gene for the hypoxic isoform of cytochrome oxidas subunit v and cytochrome | ar coexpress at varieti of oxygen concentr and switch on or off at extrem low oxygen concentr | by shift cell from on oxygen concentr to anoth we have that aerob gene ar faster than hypoxic gene and that transcript from both type of gene ar over quickli | these find have import implic for cytochrome oxidas function and biogenesi and for model of oxygen sens in yeast |
