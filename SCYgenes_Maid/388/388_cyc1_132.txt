sequenc and chromosom local of two pet gene for cytochrome oxidas assembl in saccharomyc | the nuclear gene pet and pet ar for the assembl of activ cytochrome oxidas in | yet their gene product ar not subunit of the final assembl cytochrome oxidas complex | plasmid bear pet or pet by their abil to complement the pet or pet | respect | by restrict map | subclon | and delet analysi of yeast dna fragment that complement these | the pet and pet gene to smaller region of dna | which then from both strand | the pet open read frame is of codon and the pet open read frame is of codon | neither the pet nor pet dna sequenc have been previous | and the amino acid sequenc of the pet and pet open read frame exhibit no signific primari amino acid sequenc similar to other protein sequenc avail in the nbrf data base | or from translat genbank sequenc | by hybridization of pet or pet probe first to chromosom and next to librari of physicalli fragment of yeast genom dna | the map locat of the pet and pet gene | pet is on chromosom v near the hi gene and pet is on chromosom x near the cyc gene |
