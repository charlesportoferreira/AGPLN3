mutagenesi of histidin demonstr the import of loop loop and loop protein interact for the function of iso cytochrome | in yeast iso cytochrome | the side chain of histidin | hi | attach omega loop to the main bodi of the protein by form hydrogen bond to the backbon atom carbonyl of glutam acid | the hi side chain also form stabil intra loop interact through hydrogen bond to the backbon amid of asparagin | to investig the import of loop protein attach and intra loop interact to the structur and function of thi protein | seri of site and random at hi | yeast strain express these variant protein for their abil to grow on non ferment carbon sourc and for their intracellular product of cytochrome | while the data show that at hi lead to slightli intracellular amount of cytochrome | the level of cytochrome function is more | the data suggest that cytochrome reductas bind is more than cytochrome oxidas or lactat dehydrogenase bind | we propos that at thi increas loop mobil | which | in turn | decreas the protein | abil to bind redox partner |
