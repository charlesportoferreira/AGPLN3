yeast and activ both bind to the cyc upstream activ site | ua | in an interdepend manner | transcript activ by the yeast cyc upstream activ site uasup requir the product of both the and regulatori gene | we show here that both and in yeast extract bind to uasup and give rise to singl protein dna complex | in nondenatur polyacrylamide gel | that both product ar part of complex shown by alter the mobil of the complex by fuse either or to beta galactosidas | further | methylate interfer footprint that sequenc in uasup in complex ident to those in either fusion protein complex | bind center on the sequenc tgattggt | also in the uass of other gene subject to activ by the system and to the ccaat box sequenc in higher cell | the bind of either or when in strain mutant in the complementari gene | thu the bind of and to uasup is interdepend | the involv of multipl gene product in bind to singl site is discuss with refer to other system in yeast and higher cell |
