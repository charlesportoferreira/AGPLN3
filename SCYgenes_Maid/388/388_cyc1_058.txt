nativ tertiari structur in an state | the state is an equilibrium speci that is to repres the molten globul | an on pathwai protein fold intermedi with nativ secondari structur and non nativ | fluctuat tertiari structur | we yeast iso ferricytochrom to test for an evolutionari invari tertiari interact in it state | thermal denatur by circular dichroism | cd | spectropolarimetri to determin state and nativ state stabil | delta ga revers d and delta gn revers d | we the wild type protein | seven variant with substitut at the interfac between the n and termin helic | and four control variant | the control have the same amino acid chang as the interfac variant | but the chang ar close to | not at | the interfac | we also the ph and sulfat concentr depend and that while these factor affect the far uv cd spectra of the least stabl variant | thei do not alter the differ in stabil between the wild type protein and the variant | delta ga revers d versu delta gn revers d plot for the interfac variant ha slope near uniti and the control variant have near wild type stabil | these result show that the helix helix interact stabil the state and the nativ state to the same degre | confirm our preliminari report | we that the heat capac chang for state denatur is approxim | of the valu for nativ state denatur | indic that the state interior is nativ like | we discuss our result in relat to ferricytochrom fold kinet |
