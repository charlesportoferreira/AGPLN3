replac of cysteine of saccharomyc iso cytochrome with threonin | stabil of the mutant protein | site mutagenesi ha been to chang the codon for cysteine of saccharomyc iso cytochrome to threonin codon | the result protein is activ in vivo | is as in the wild type protein and ha optic properti indistinguish from those of the wild type protein | the threonin iso cytochrome fulli revers electrochem behaviour and mid point reduct potenti of mv versu nhe | in addit | thi mutant doe not demonstr tendenc to autoreduc or to dimer as doe the wild type protein | these properti of the threonin mutant establish that it will provid us background in which to make subsequ for mechanist and physical studi of yeast iso cytochrome |
