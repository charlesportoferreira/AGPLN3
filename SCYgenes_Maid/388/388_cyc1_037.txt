cytochrome variant resist to heme degrad by hydrogen peroxid | background | cytochrome ha peroxidas like activ and can catalyz the oxid of varieti of organ substrat | includ aromat | organosulfur and compound | like peroxidas | cytochrome is by hydrogen peroxid | dure thi inactiv the heme prosthet group is | result | variant of the iso cytochrome by site mutagenesi and to be more stabl in the presenc of hydrogen peroxid than the wild type | no heme destruct in tripl variant | tyr | phe | asn | il | cy | thr | with the catalyt hydrogen peroxid concentr of mm | even follow the loss of catalyt activ | wherea both doubl variant tyr | phe | cy | thr and asn | il | cy | thr greater rate of peroxid heme destruct than with the wild type protein | conclus | heme destruct and catalyt inactiv ar two independ process | an intern water molecul | wat | is shown to be import in the heme destruct process | the absenc of protein radic in the resist variant suggest that the protein radic is necessari in the heme destruct process | but presum is not in the reaction lead up to the protein inactiv |
