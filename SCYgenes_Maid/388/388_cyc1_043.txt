thermal stabil of hydrophobic heme pocket variant of cytochrome | microcalorimetri ha been to measur the stabil of mutat variant of yeast iso cytochrome in which f and l have been by other hydrophobic amino acid | specif | f ha been by y and l by | the doubl mutant fy | la iso ha also been | and the mutat perturb ar to those for the two singl mutant | fy iso and la iso | result ar in term of known crystallographic structur | the data show that | the destabil of the mutant protein is similar in magnitud to that which is theoret by the more obviou mutat structur effect | the free energi of destabil of the doubl mutant | fy | la iso | is less than the sum of those of the two singl mutant | almost certainli becaus | in the doubl mutant | the oh group of y is abl to protrud into the caviti by the la substitut | the more favor structur accommod of the new oh group in the doubl mutant lead to addit stabil through | further decreas in the volum of intern caviti and | format of an extra protein protein hydrogen bond |
