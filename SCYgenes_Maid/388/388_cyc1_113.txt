regul of cytochrome express in the aerob respiratori yeast kluyveromyce | transcript regul of the klcyc gene from the aerob respiratori yeast kluyveromyce ha been | the klcyc gene produc two transcript of differ size | in contrast with the singl transcript for cyc and cyc from saccharomyc | and for the cyc gene from schwanniomyc occidentali | both klcyc transcript respond in the same wai to the regulatori signal here | the transcript of klcyc is by oxygen and thi control is mediat by heme | the klcyc gene is also subject to catabolit repress | heterolog express in | mutant reveal that the factor and take part in the regulatori mechan |
