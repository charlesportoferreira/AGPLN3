modul of promot occup by cooper dna bind and activ domain function is major determin of transcript regul by activ in vivo | bind of transcript activ to promot is prerequisit process in transcript activ | it is well that the effici of activ bind to promot is by the affin of direct interact between the dna bind domain of an activ and it specif target sequenc | howev | i describ here that activ bind to promot is augment in vivo by the effect of two other determin that have not been gener appreci | i | the number of activ bind site present in promot and | ii | the potenc of activ domain of activ | multipl site within promot can cooper recruit cognat factor regardless of whether thei contain an effect activ domain | thi cooper can result in the synergistic activ of transcript | the second effect is the enhanc of activ bind to promot by the presenc of activ domain | in thi case | activ domain ar not simpli to the promot by the dna bind domain but instead assist the dna bind domain be onto the promot | thi effect of activ domain on dna bind is instrument in determin how potent activ can induc steep transcript increas at low concentr |
