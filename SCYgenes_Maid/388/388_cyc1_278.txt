upstream activ site of the cyc gene of saccharomyc ar activ when invert but not when downstream of the quot | tata box quot | the abil of the upstream activ site | uass | of the yeast cyc gene to function when invert or when downstream of the quot | tata box quot | is | invers of base pair dna fragment bear the uass leav the activ of the site almost complet intact | in contrast | posit the site downstream of the tata box or in the intron of cyc ribosom protein lacz tribrid gene almost total abolish their activ | in the latter construct | the separ between the uass and tata box is roughli equival to that between the element in the intact cyc promot region | the uass ar shown not to interrupt transcript of splice in thi construct sinc gal ua upstream of the tata box give rise to galactos induc express of the tribrid gene | the inabl of the uass to function in the intron is partli due to sequenc between the intron and the tata box that block the activ signal | howev | larg compon of the inact of the site in the intron appear to be their downstream locat | thi result is discuss in light of possibl mechan of upstream activ in yeast |
