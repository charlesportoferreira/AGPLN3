new affect mutagenesi in yeast | previous in baker | yeast | saccharomyc | that impair mutagenesi all with the aid of test that either exclus or predominantli detect base pair substitut | to avoid thi bia | we have potenti mutant clone for uv revers of the frameshift allel | hi | and have mutant that give much yield of revert | complement and recombin test show that of these carri at the previous known rev | rev and rev loci | while the remain defin new gene | rev | rev and rev | the rev ar readili in mani genet background and | like the rev mutat | impart onli limit defici for mutagenesi | it is like | therefor that the rev | and rev | gene function ar onli remot concern with thi process | the rev mutant have more gener defici | howev | as well as mark sensit to uv and an spontan mutat rate | properti that suggest the rev gene is directli in mutat induct | the rev gene is about cm proxim to cyc on chromosom x |
