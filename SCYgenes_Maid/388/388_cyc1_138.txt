probe weakli polar interact in cytochrome | theoret | statist | and model studi suggest that protein ar by weakli polar attract between sulfur atom and properli orient aromat ring | the two sulfur contain amino acid | methionin and cysteine | occur frequent among function allel in random mutant librari of saccharomyc iso cytochrome gene at posit that form weakli polar aromat aromat interact | the wild type protein | to determin if weakli polar sulfur aromat interact the aromat aromat interact | the structur and stabil of two variant | phenylalanine | which interact with tyrosine | by methionin and cysteine | the cysteine modifi to form the methionin and cysteine analog | methyl cysteine | cyssme | proton nmr studi indic that chang phe to or cyssme affect onli local structur and that the structur of sulfur contain variant ar nearli ident | analysi of chemic shift and nuclear overhaus effect data indic that both sulfur contain side chain ar in posit to form weakli polar interact with tyr | the fm and fcsme variant ar kcal mol less stabl than iso cytochrome at k | comparison of the stabil of the fm and fcsme variant allow evalu of the potenti weakli polar interact between the addit sulfur atom of fcsme and the aromat moieti of tyr | the fcsme | ct variant is | kcal mol more stabl than the fm | ct protein | the stabil is explain by the differ in hydrophobiciti of the sulfur contain side chain | we conclud that ani weakli polar interact between the addit sulfur and the aromat ring is too weak to detect or is mask by destabil contribut to the free energi of denatur |
