protein stabil by engin metal chelat | ligand can shift protein | fold | unfold equilibrium by bind with higher affin to the nativ state | metal chelat site consist of two histidin separ by three residu | hi x hi | engin into an alpha helix provid gener and easili implement mean for protein stabil by thi mechan | we have thi approach with the iso cytochrome of saccharomyc with histidin at posit and in it n termin alpha helix | on mm cu | ii | complex to iminodiacet stabil the cytochrome variant by ca | kcal | mol | as by guanidinium chlorid unfold | the protein | fold | unfold equilibrium is by free energi equal to that from the metal ion | preferenti bind to the nativ protein | given the ubiqu of surfac alpha helic and the addit possibl of insert di histidin chelat site into turn and beta structur | we conclud that thi is us method for protein stabil |
