differenti mismatch repair can explain the disproportion between physical distanc and recombin frequenc of cyc in yeast | recombin rate have been in two point cross of variou cyc that caus the loss or nonfunct of iso cytochrome in the yeast saccharomyc | recombin aris by three differ mean | includ x rai mitot recombin | spontan mitot recombin | and meiotic recombin | heteroallel diploid strain by cross cyc mutant contain seri of alter at or near the same site to cyc mutant contain alter at variou distanc | mark disproportion between physical distanc and recombin frequenc with certain cyc | indic that certain base can significantli affect recombin | the marker effect more when the two mutat site of the heteroallel within about base pair | but separ by at least base pair | two allel | cyc and cyc | which by g | g transvers at nucleotid posit and | respect | rise to especi high rate of recombin | other have differ substitut at the same nucleotid posit not associ with abnorm high recombin frequenc | we suggest that these marker effect ar due to the lack of repair of either g | g or | base pair | while the other base pair of the heteroallel undergo substanti repair | furthermor | we suggest that recombin frequenc ar due to the concomit repair of both mismatch within the same dna tract |
