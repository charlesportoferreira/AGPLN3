mutat perturb of the cytochrome alkalin transit | the possibl influenc of phe in the cytochrome alkalin isomer ha been by spectrophotometr ph titrat of famili of mutant yeast iso cytochrome in which the ident of the at thi posit ha been vari | the pka for the exchang of the heme iron ligand from ph titrat in which the fe charg transfer band | nm | and to be | for the wild type | for ser | for gly | for leu | and | for il | ph jump experi | davi et al | j | biol | chem | that substitut at posit affect the alkalin isomer by lower the pka of the titrat group by as much as | pk unit | for the ser and gly variant | there is also small effect on the keq for the ligand exchang equilibrium | on the basi of these find | we conclud that on critic role for phe in the wild type protein is stabil of the nativ heme bind environ |
