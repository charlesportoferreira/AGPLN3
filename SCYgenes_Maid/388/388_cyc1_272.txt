amino termin process of mutant form of yeast iso cytochrome | the specif of methionin aminopeptidas and acetyltransferas | amino termin process in the yeast saccharomyc ha been by examin numer mutation form of iso cytochrome | amino termin residu of methionin in sequenc have penultim residu of arginin | asparagin | glutamin | isoleucin | leucin | lysine | and methionin | in contrast | the amino termin methionin residu exercis from residu of alanin | glycine | and threonin and partial excis from residu of valin | the result suggest the occurr of yeast aminopeptidas that remov amino termin residu of methionin when thei preced certain amino acid | systematic search of the literatur for amino termin sequenc at initi site suggest the hypothetical yeast aminopeptidas usual ha the same specif as the amino peptidas from bacteria and higher eukaryot | our result and the result from the literatur search suggest that the aminopeptidas cleav amino termin methionin when it preced residu of alanin | glycine | prolin | serin | threonin | and valin but not when it preced residu of arginin | asparagin | aspart acid | glutamin glutam acid | isoleucin | leucin | lysine | or methionin | in contrast to the normal iso cytochrome and in contrast to the major of the mutation protein | certain form acetyl includ the follow sequenc | acetyl | ac | il arg | ac il ly | ac asn | and ac asn asn | we suggest yeast contain acetyltransferas that acetyl these mutant form of iso cytochrome becaus their amino termin region resembl the amino termin region of natur occur protein which ar normal acetyl | the lack of acetyl of close sequenc suggest that the hypothetical acetyltransferas ar specif for certain amino termin sequenc and that the amino termin residu mai plai critic role in determin these specif |
