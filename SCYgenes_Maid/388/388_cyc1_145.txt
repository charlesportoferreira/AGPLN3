isol | character and function of the two cytochrome of the yeast candida parapsilosi | candida parapsilosi is strictli aerob yeast which possess two respiratori chain with peculiar organis | differ from that of plant mitochondria | besid the classic electron transport pathwai | mitochondria of | parapsilosi develop an altern pathwai | which doe not branch off at the ubiquinon level | but merg at the complex iv level | two pool of cytochrome by their spectrometr and potentiometr properti | i | sequenti cytochrome reduct by two substrat | pm | em mv | and tmpd | em mv | tmpd the reduct of cytochrome with maxima at | and | nm for the alpha and the soret band | respect | wherea cytochrome reduc by pm maxima at | and | nm | ii | two midpoint redox potenti at mv and mv | respect | the two cytochrome copurifi by ion exchang chromatographi on amberlit | after thi step | the two cytochrome can alwai be differenti by tmpd and pm | these reduct promot differ absorpt band | the two cytochrome separ by revers phase hplc | thi last purif step two protein with the same rel molecular mass of but differ amino acid composit | comparison of n termin sequenc differ between the two protein | it hypothesize that on cytochrome is implic in the function of the main chain and the other in that of the secondari pathwai |
