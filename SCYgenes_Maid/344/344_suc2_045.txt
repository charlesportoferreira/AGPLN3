express of the suc gene of saccharomyc is by low level of glucos | high level of glucos repress express of the suc gene in the yeast saccharomyc | we have that low level of glucos ar for maxim transcript of suc | suc express is about five to ten fold in cell grow on low level of glucos | to cell grow on galactos or glycerol | two piec of evid suggest that thi low glucos express is mediat by repress mechan that involv an upstream repress site in the suc promot | ur | suc | first | delet of the ur | suc | result in express of the suc gene in the absenc of glucos | and second the ur | suc | mediat six fold repress of report gene when into heterolog promot | howev | thi ur | suc | mediat repress occur on all carbon sourc | suggest that thi ur element act in concert with all other promot element to respond to low concentr of glucos | thi repress requir the gener repressor ssnp | which encod glucos transport that appear to be sensor of low level of glucos | is also for low glucos express of suc |
