relationship between protein kinas and derepress of differ enzyme | the pkc gene in the yeast saccharomyc encod for protein kinas which is known to control map kinas cascad consist of differ kinas | bck | mkk and mkk | and mpk | thi cascad affect the cell wall integr but the phenotyp of pkcdelta mutant suggest addit target that have not yet been | heinisch et al | mol | microbiol | the pkcdelta mutant | as oppos to other mutant in the map kinas cascad | displai defect in the control of carbon metabol | on of them occur in the derepress of suc gene after exhaust of glucos from the medium | suggest an involv of pkcp in the derepress process that is not by the downstream map kinas cascad | in thi work | we demonstr that pkcp is for the increas of the activ of enzymatic system dure the derepress process | we that pkcp is in the derepress of invertas and alcohol dehydrogenase activ | on the other hand | it seem not to be necessari for the derepress of the enzyme of the gal system | our result suggest that pkcp is act through the main glucos repress pathwai | sinc introduct of an addit mutat in the pkc gene in yeast strain alreadi present in the hxkii or mig gene doe not interfer with the typical phenotyp in these singl mutant | moreov | our data indic that pkcp particip in thi process through the control of the cellular local of the mig transcript factor |
