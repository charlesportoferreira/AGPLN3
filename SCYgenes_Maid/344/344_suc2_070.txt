chromatin structur of the yeast suc promot in regulatori mutant | we have previous that two nucleosom ar from the promot of the saccharomyc suc gene upon depress by glucos starvat | to gain further insight into the chang accompani derepress at the chromatin level we have the chromatin structur of the suc promot in sever mutant affect suc express | the non derepress mutant | and present chromatin structur characterist of the state | irrespect of the presenc or absenc of glucos | the non repress mutant | mig and | as well as the doubl mutant snf exhibit an open chromatin structur even in the presenc of glucos | these result suggest that the dna bind protein by mig is necessari to produc the characterist pattern of chromatin and that the protein kinas is suffici to produc the chromatin pattern | model is for the transit that result in open up of the chromatin structur |
