clue to the origin of high extern invertas activ in immobil grow yeast | prolong suc transcript and less suscept of the to endogen proteolysi | express of the suc gene encod invertas us free and gelatin immobil yeast cell to try to explain the high activ of thi by immobil cell when to grow in nutrient medium | the result that at least two factor ar probabl respons for the accumul of invertas in immobil cell | first | the express of the suc gene throughout growth in immobil cell | wherea it express onli transient in free cell | second | invertas of immobil cell shown to be less suscept to endogen proteolyt attack than that of the correspond free cell | these result have been | respect | in term of diffusion limit and chang in the pattern of invertas glycosylation due to growth of yeast in an immobil state |
