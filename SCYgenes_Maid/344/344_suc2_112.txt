evolut of the dispers suc gene famili of saccharomyc by rearrang of chromosom telomer | the suc gene famili of saccharomyc contain six structur gene for invertas | suc through suc and suc | which ar on differ chromosom | most yeast strain do not carri all six suc gene and instead carri natur neg | suc | allel at some or all suc loci | we the physical structur of suc and suc loci | except for suc | which is an unusu member of the famili | all of the suc gene ar veri close to telomer and ar flank by sequenc | on the centromer proxim side of the gene | the region contain x sequenc | which ar sequenc adjac to telomer | m | chan and | k | tye | cell | on the other side of the gene | the homolog includ about kilobas of flank sequenc and then extend into y | element | which is an element often distal to the x sequenc at telomer | chan and tye | cell | thu | these suc gene and flank sequenc ar embed in adjac sequenc | chromosom carri suc allel | except suc | lack suc structur gene and portion of the flank sequenc | the result indic that the dispers of suc gene to differ chromosom by rearrang of chromosom telomer |
