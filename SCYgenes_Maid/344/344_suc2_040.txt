glucos repress in saccharomyc is to the glucos concentr rather than the glucos flux | glucos plai an import regulatori role in the yeast saccharomyc | which is mostli at the transcript level by glucos repress | the signal that initi glucos repress is unknown | but data indic that it is at or abov the level of glucos phosphat | suggest the involv of either the intracellular or extracellular glucos concentr or the glucos flux in trigger glucos repress | we have the role of the glucos flux and the extracellular glucos concentr in glucos repress by grow the cell in continu cultur under nitrogen limit | by step wise increas in the glucos feed concentr | the glucos flux and extracellular glucos concentr in an accur wai | furthermor | the glucos flux and glucos concentr independ of each other by increas the dilut rate or by the us of fructos as substrat | us these approach we demonstr that glucos repress is to the extracellular | or intracellular | glucos concentr rather than the glucos flux | at extern glucos concentr lower than mm | glucos repress of suc gene transcript not trigger | wherea glucos repress of thi gene when the glucos concentr mm | compar effect for the glucos repress carbon sourc fructos |
