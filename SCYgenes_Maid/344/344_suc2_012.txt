interact of the repressor nrg and nrg with the protein kinas in saccharomyc | the protein kinas is essenti for the transcript of glucos gene in saccharomyc | we nrg as protein that interact with in the two hybrid system | nrg is | h | zinc finger protein that is to nrg | repressor of the glucos and sta | glucoamylas | gene | also interact with nrg in the two hybrid system and co immunoprecipit with both nrg and nrg from cell extract | lexa fusion to nrg repress transcript from promot contain lexa bind site | indic that nrg also function as repressor | an nrg fusion to green fluoresc protein is to the nucleu | and thi local is not by carbon sourc | final | we show that vp fusion to nrg and nrg allow low level express of suc in glucos grown cell | and we present evid that nrg and nrg contribut to glucos repress of the dog gene | these result suggest that nrg and nrg ar direct or indirect target of the kinas and function in glucos repress of subset of gene |
