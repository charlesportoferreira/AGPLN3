yeast mig repressor is to the mammalian earli growth respons and wilm | tumour finger protein | we have yeast gene | mig | which encod ch zinc finger protein in glucos repress | the finger of mig ar veri similar to those present in the mammalian egr finger protein | which ar dure the earli growth respons | and also to the finger protein by human gene that is in wilm | tumour cell | mig protein bind to two site in the upstream region of suc | yeast gene that is by glucos | the mig site close resembl the sequenc by the egr protein | thu | finger protein that ar similar in both amino acid sequenc and dna specif ar in the respons of yeast to glucos | and in the mammalian earli growth respons |
