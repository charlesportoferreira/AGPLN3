purif and character of the invertas from schizosaccharomyc | compar analysi with the invertas from saccharomyc | invertas | ec | to homogen from exponenti grow cell of schizosaccharomyc fulli de for synthesi of the | and shown to be high molecular mass glycoprotein that can be in the presenc of m urea | sd into ident subunit with an appar molecular mass of kda | the carbohydr moieti | account for | of the total mass | is compos of equimolar amount of mannos and galactos | there is small amount of glucosamin | which is probabl in the linkag to the protein moieti | sinc the is sensit to treatment with endoglycosidas h | the composit of the carbohydr moieti resembl that in higher eukaryot glycoprotein and differ from glycoprotein in saccharomyc | the protein portion of each subunit is polypeptide of molecular mass kda | veri similar to the invertas of sacch | both protein cross react with antibodi against the protein fraction of the other | indic that the two enzyme ar similar |
