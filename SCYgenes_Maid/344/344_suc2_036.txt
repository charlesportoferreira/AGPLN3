the hexokinas protein particip in regulatori dna protein complex necessari for glucos repress of the suc gene in saccharomyc | the hxk gene plai an import role in glucos repress in the yeast saccharomyc | recent we have that the hxk gene product | isoenzym of hexokinas | is both in the nucleu and in the cytoplasm of | cell | in thi work we delet analysi to identifi the essenti part of the protein mediat nuclear localis | determin of fructos kinas activ and immunoblot analysi us anti hxk antibodi in nuclei | togeth with observ of the fluoresc distribut of hxk gfp fusion protein in cell with an hxk | gfp mutant gene | that the decapeptid kkpqarkgsm | between amino acid residu and of hexokinas | is import for nuclear localis of the protein | further experiment evid | measur invertas activ in wild type and mutant cell express version of the hxk protein unabl to enter the nucleu | show that nuclear localis of hxk is necessari for glucos repress signal of the suc gene | furthermor | we demonstr us gel mobil shift analysi that hxk particip in dna protein complex with ci act regulatori element of the suc gene promot |
