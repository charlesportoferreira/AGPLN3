candida albican ubi and ubi promot region confer differenti regul of invertas product to saccharomyc cell in respons to stress | candida albican ubiquitin gene ubi and ubi ubiquitin hybrid protein in ribosom biogenesi and polyubiquitin | respect | in thi work we show that ubi and ubi promot region confer differenti express consist with the function of their gene product | hybrid gene contain the suc code region under the control of ubi or ubi promot in the yeast vector plc | invertas product in saccharomyc transform differenti | the ubi promot by stress condit | thermal upshift and | or starvat | wherea the ubi promot constitut invertas product in grow yeast cell | these result indic that the ubi promot is by stress respons signal pathwai | wherea the ubi promot is accord to the requir for protein synthesi to support cell growth |
