invertas beta galactosidas hybrid protein fail to be transport from the endoplasm reticulum in saccharomyc | the yeast suc gene code for the invertas | seri of differ size gene fusion have been between thi yeast gene and the escherichia coli lacz gene | which code for the cytoplasmic beta galactosidas | variou amount of suc nh termin code sequenc have been in frame to constant cooh termin code segment of the lacz gene | result in the synthesi of hybrid invertas beta galactosidas protein in saccharomyc | the hybrid protein exhibit beta galactosidas activ | and thei ar specif by antisera against either invertas or beta galactosidas | express of beta galactosidas activ is in manner similar to that for invertas activ from wild type suc gene | in high glucos medium and in low glucos medium | unlik wild type invertas | howev | the invertas beta galactosidas hybrid protein ar not | rather | thei appear to remain trap at veri earli stage of secretori protein transit | insert into the endoplasm reticulum | er | the hybrid protein appear onli to have undergon core glycosylation | an er process | and do not receiv the addit glycosyl modif that take place in the golgi complex | even those hybrid protein contain onli short segment of invertas sequenc at the nh terminu ar | suggest that no extens fold of the invertas polypeptide is befor initi of transmembran transfer | beta galactosidas activ by the suc lacz gene fusion cofraction on percol densiti gradient with er marker enzyme and not with other organel | in addit | the hybrid protein ar not access to cell surfac label by i | accumul of the invertas beta galactosidas hybrid protein within the er doe not appear to confer growth defect phenotyp to yeast cell | in thi locat | howev | the hybrid protein and the beta galactosidas activ thei exhibit could provid us biochem tag for yeast er membran |
