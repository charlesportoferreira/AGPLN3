express of the saccharomyc glycoprotein invertas in mous fibroblast | glycosylation | secret | and enzymatic activ | oligosaccharid process is by host and protein depend factor | to increas our understand of the rel contribut of those factor we the glycosylation of yeast invertas in heterolog system | invertas in psi cell | an nih t packag line | is effici | enzymatic activ | and heavili | it estim that the protein contain or carbohydr chain | two class can be | of an approxim size of kda and kda | respect | the size differ ar due to differ in glycosylation | the smaller class contain two high mannos carbohydr chain | the remaind is of the complex type | sialylate and most like tri or tetraantennari | thi profil parallel the situat with invertas glycosylation in yeast | where of or chain remain unprocess | the larger size class of invertas in mous fibroblast ha differ profil | sinc it contain probabl onli complex type glycan | there ar no appar differ | howev | in the size of the protein backbon between the two size class | when invertas is in the presenc of the mannosidas inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin | process is complet | sinc all glycan ar suscept to endo beta n acetylglucosaminidas h | the glucosidas inhibitor deoxynojirimycin doe not inhibit process complet | in both case secret of the protein is not | the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin prevent secret of invertas complet when cell ar cultur at degre | at degre | howev | nonglycosylate invertas can be in the medium | these data suggest that glycosylation of invertas seem to be essenti for the earli step of the secretori pathwai but is less critic for later event |
