new glucos repress gene from the analysi of chromatin structur in delet mutant of yeast suc | we have previous shown that some chang occur in the chromatin structur of the | of the yeast suc gene in go from to an activ state | in an attempt to find out the caus of these chang | we have out experi in which mutant copi of suc lack either | or | flank have been analys for their transcript activ and chromatin structur | these experi us to discard ani relationship between suc transcript and chromatin chang within it | sequenc of thi and mrna analysi | howev | in the locat of put peroxisom oxoacyl coa thiolas gene | pot | which is repress by glucos | the disrupt of the gene yeast strain unabl to us oleic acid as carbon sourc | thi is the first time that chromatin structur analysi ha the identif of new gene |
