dnase i sensit of the chromatin of the yeast suc gene for invertas | the dnase i sensit of chromatin of the yeast suc gene | which encod two form of invertas | ha been both in the genom and in multicopi carri the gene and it flake sequenc | wherea littl if ani differ in the dnase i sensit of the flank region between the and the state | derepress of the gene accompani by larg increas in the sensit of the transcrib region | well dnase i site center at approxim bp downstream from the end of the code region | thi site seem to be flank in the | non code region by strictli nucleosom | and the structur of thi region chang upon derepress | in the | non code region two dnase i site have been flank the tata box and of three close space site occur in an upstream regulatori sequenc | the structur of these latter site depend on the on off state of transcript |
