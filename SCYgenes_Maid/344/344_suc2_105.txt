secret defect in the signal sequenc for saccharomyc invertas | nine in the signal sequenc region of the gene specifi the saccharomyc invertas in vitro | the consequ of these after return the gene to yeast cell | short delet and two extens substitut normal express and secret of invertas | other substitut and longer delet the format of extracellular invertas | yeast cell carri thi second class of mutant gene novel activ intern form of invertas that the follow properti | the new intern protein the mobil in denatur gel expect of invertas polypeptide that defect signal sequenc and otherwis unmodifi | the larg increas in molecular weight characterist of glycosylation not seen | on nondenatur gel the mutant enzyme as heterodim with normal form of invertas that is known to be cytoplasmic | show that the mutant form of the ar assembl in the same compart as the cytoplasmic | all of the mutant enzyme solubl and not associ with the membran compon after fraction of crude cell extract on gradient | therefor | these signal sequenc result in the product of activ intern invertas that ha the abil to enter the secretori pathwai | thi demonstr that the signal sequenc is for the earliest step in membran transloc |
