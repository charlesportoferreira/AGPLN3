structur analysi of the | region of yeast suc gene analog palindrom in suc | mal and gal | in the yeast saccharomyc six unlink structur gene for invertas | the suc gene | ar known | we about bp of the | non code region and the first bp of the code region of the gene suc | suc | suc and suc and them with the previous gene suc and suc | sarokin and carlson | all ar highli within the code region but in the non code region suc show some differ and suc is more highli | two differ kind of tata box | the more strongli gene suc | and have the sequenc tataaa and the more weakli gene suc | and have tacaaa | though the suc sequenc is in gener more to the other suc gene | the region between and | of suc is nearli ident to suc | thi could be due to gene convers between suc and the silent suc degre allel which occur in the strain carri suc | within the upstream region of all the suc gene three region with palindrom sequenc analog to stem and loop structur | compar structur could be in similar posit in the upstream sequenc of the diverg transcrib yeast gene pair mal malt and gal gal | implic for the import of these structur in the regul and initi of transcript ar discuss |
