detect of site specif proteolysi in secretori pathwai | we report here genet assai suitabl for detect site specif proteolysi in secretori pathwai | the yeast invertas is to the lumen region of the yeast golgi membran protein ste via proteas substrat domain in saccharomyc strain lack invertas | when the substrat is cleav by specif proteas | the invertas moieti is releas into the periplasm space where it degrad to glucos and fructos | therefor | site specif proteolysi can be by monitor the growth of yeast cell on select media contain as the sole carbon sourc | we the valid of thi assai with yeast kex and human tmprss proteas | our data suggest that thi in vivo assai is an effici method for the determin of substrat specif and mutat analysi of or membran proteas |
