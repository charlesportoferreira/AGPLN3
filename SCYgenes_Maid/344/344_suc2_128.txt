carbohydr structur of yeast invertas | demonstr of form with onli core oligosaccharid and form with polysaccharide chain | invertas | extract from broken cell of saccharomyc x mm mannan mutant | separ into fraction insolubl in | ammonium sulfat | invertas | carbohydr | and solubl fraction | invertas | carbohydr | the latter with antibodi specif for the alpha lead to mannos of the mannoprotein outer chain | wherea the invertas to react with thi antiserum although it react with serum against termin alpha lead to mannos unit that ar characterist of the mannoprotein core | bacteri endo alpha lead to mannanas the outer chain from the invertas and it to form that similar in electrophoret and immunochem properti to the invertas | wherea the endomannanas littl effect on the latter invertas | the result suggest that the invertas is form of the to which onli the core oligosaccharid unit been | and the invertas repres an fraction to which the polysaccharide outer chain also attach | strong anomer pmr signal for unsubstitut alpha lead to mannos in the invertas | and much signal in the invertas and endomannanas invertas | support these conclus | endo n acetyl beta glucosaminidas digest of the and invertas | as well as of wild type yeast invertas | an appar ident seri of to carbohydr contain protein that separ by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresi in sodium dodecyl sulfat but that migrat as singl band on isoelectr focus | the band from about | to | dalton and by the size of on or more carbohydr core unit each of mannos and n acetylglucosamin | the result suggest that the extern invertas molecul contain some core unit without attach outer chain | and that the cell contain precursor form of the to which onli the core unit have been | in support of thi conclus | pmr spectra and chromatograph pattern show that the core fragment from the | and wild type invertas ar essenti ident |
