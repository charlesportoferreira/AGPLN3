nucleotid sequenc of the yeast suc gene for invertas | the yeast suc gene is structur gene for both the and intracellular form of invertas | we have the nucleotid sequenc of the code region and the | and | flank region | the code region for the signal peptid contain precursor to invertas and for the intracellular invertas begin at differ initi codon within the suc gene but share the same read frame | the amino acid sequenc for the two form of invertas from the nucleotid sequenc ar consist with the properti of the enzyme | potenti site for glycosylation of the invertas ar |
