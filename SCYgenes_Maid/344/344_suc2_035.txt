isol and character of an invertas and it repressor gene from schizosaccharomyc | pcr to isol an invertas homolog gene from the fission yeast schizosaccharomyc | the inv | gene encod protein of amino acid with potenti asparagin glycosylation site | and ha | and | ident to the schwanniomyc occidentali and saccharomyc suc invertas | when the inv | gene | strain detect invertas activ | thi result that the inv | gene encod onli on activ invertas in | cell | the transcript of inv | is in the presenc of glucos | the transcript of inv | not in cyrdelta strain which lack adenyl cyclase activ | unlik transcript of | fbp | gene | we have an | gene | scr | that encod homolog of the aspergillu nidulan crea which is for glucos repress of the glyconeogenic pathwai | although the delet of scr | not influenc the transcript of fbp | gene | glucos repress of the inv | gene sever | these result that glucos repress of inv | gene is depend on scr | gene | and | camp signal pathwai mai not be essenti for glucos repress of inv | gene | copyright academ press |
