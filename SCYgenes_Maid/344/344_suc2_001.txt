the glucos nuclear local of hexokinas in saccharomyc is mig depend | two major mediat of glucos repress in saccharomyc ar the protein mig and hxk | the mechan of hxk depend glucos repress pathwai is not well understood | but the mig depend part of the pathwai ha been elucid in great detail | here we report that hxk ha glucos nuclear local and that mig | transcript repressor respons for glucos repress of mani gene | is to sequest hxk into the nucleu | mig and hxk in vivo in yeast two hybrid assai and in vitro in immunoprecipit and glutathion transferas pull down experi | we that the ly | decapeptid of hxk | which is necessari for nuclear local of the protein | is also essenti for interact with the mig protein | our result also show that the hxk mig interact is of physiological signific becaus both protein have been interact togeth in cluster with dna fragment contain the mig site of suc promot | we conclud that hxk oper by interact with mig to gener repressor complex in the nucleu of | dure growth in glucos medium |
