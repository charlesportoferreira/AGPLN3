regul of nuclear gene encod mitochondri protein in saccharomyc | select for mutant which releas glucos repress of the cyb gene to identifi gene which regul repress of mitochondri biogenesi | we have two of these as the previous | cat and rox gene | in these gene not onli releas glucos repress of cyb but also gener releas respir of the mutant from glucos repress | in addit | both mutant ar partial defect in cyb express when grown on nonferment carbon sourc | indic posit regulatori role as well | rox by complement of glucos induc floccul phenotyp of an amber mutant and ha been as new leftmost marker on chromosom | the rox mutant ha onli modest defect in glucos repress of gal but is substanti compromis in galactos induct of gal express | thi mutant also ha suc express on nonrepress carbon sourc | we have also the regul of cyb in strain carri null mutat in two other glucos repress gene | hxk and | and show that hxk is neg regul of cyb | wherea appear to be posit effector of cyb express |
