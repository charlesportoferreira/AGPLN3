the natur occur silent invertas structur gene suc zero contain an amber stop codon that is occasion read through | the yeast invertas structur gene suc ha two natur occur allel | the activ on and silent allel suc zero | strain carri suc zero ar unabl to ferment and do not show detect invertas activ | we have suc zero and an amber codon at posit of amino acid | howev | transform carri suc zero on multicopi abl to ferment and detect invertas activ | full length invertas in gel stain for activ invertas and in immunoblot | therefor we that the amber codon is occasion read as an amino acid | the frequenc of read through is about | of all translat event |
