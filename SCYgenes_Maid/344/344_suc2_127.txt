suc gene of saccharomyc | structur gene for the larg | glycoprotein | and small | carbohydr free | form of invertas | saccharomyc revert strain d er ha been shown to contain thermosensit form of the larg | glycoprotein | and small | carbohydr free | invertas and veri low level of the small | along with wild type level of the larg form | t | mizunaga et al | mol | cell | biol | these characterist in cross of the revert strain with wild type ferment | suc | or nonfer | suc | strain | in addit | there is tight linkag between and maltos ferment in revert d er | characterist of the suc and mal gene | from thi we infer that singl revers event is respons for the sever chang in d er | and that thi mutat map within or veri close to the suc gene present in the ancestor strain d | the revert suc allel in d er | suc r | independ of the wild type suc gene when both present in diploid cell | diploid carri onli the wild type or the mutant gene invertas with the characterist of the parent suc | haploid | the possibl that modifi gene respons for the alter in the invertas of revert d er rule out by appropri cross | we conclud that suc is structur gene that code for both the larg and the small form of invertas and suggest that suc through suc ar structur gene as well |
