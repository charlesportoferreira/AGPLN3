analysi of glucos repress in saccharomyc by puls glucos to galactos limit continu cultur | in thi studi | glucos repress in saccharomyc analys under physiological condit | at both the molecular and physiological level | by puls glucos to galactos limit continu cultur | dure thi puls of glucos | the galactos feed constant | directli after the glucos puls | carbon dioxid product while oxygen consumpt constant | demonstr that the surplu of glucos been consum by mean of ferment | the direct accumul of galactos in the medium after the glucos puls that the consumpt of galactos been stop instantan | galactos uptak experi that the galactos transport still present but appar incap of galactos uptak | which could be due to inhibit of the galactos transport by glucos | the total concentr of camp from nmol g at t to nmol g at t | min | after min the concentr of camp gradual again to the normal level | within min after the addit of glucos | the transcript of the gal gene and suc | in addit | the transcript of the hxk gene | encod hexokinas isoenzym | also | which demonstr that the hxk gene is at the transcript level compar with invertas |
