evid that control chromatin structur over both the tata and ua region of the suc promot in saccharomyc | the complex of the yeast saccharomyc ha been shown to control gene express by control chromatin structur | we have the promot of the suc gene | gene strongli by | by high resolut analysi of micrococc nucleas digest | thi analysi suggest that there ar at least four nucleosom over the suc tata and ua region under condit repress suc transcript | under derepress condit thi entir promot region is much more sensit to mnase digest | analysi of an delta mutant demonstr that even under derepress condit the suc promot is resist to mnase digest | thu | the complex appear to control chromatin structur over both the suc tata and ua region | the presenc of nucleosom over both promot region mai explain the strong requir of suc for function |
