compar properti of extern and intern invertas from the yeast suc gene | saccharomyc extern and intern invertas have been by introduc the normal and modifi suc gene into yeast multicopi plasmid | which then to transform yeast strain resist to repress by glucos | amino acid composit analysi of these enzyme | in addit to end group sequenc | the dna sequenc data of taussig and carlson | taussig | r | and carlson | m | nucleic acid re | indic that both enzyme in the same gene | comparison of the properti of carbohydr contain extern invertas and it nonglycosylate intern form that although the carbohydr not appear to influenc the conform of the peptid backbon | as by circular dichroism analys | it presenc consider the abil of guanidin hcl extern invertas to be rel to intern invertas | the mr of the intern enzyme to be greatli depend on ph with the be monom at ph | dimer at ph | and an appar octam at ph |
