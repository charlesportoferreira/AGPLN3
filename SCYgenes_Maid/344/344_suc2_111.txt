invertas signal and matur sequenc substitut that delai intercompartment transport of activ | the role of structur signal in intercompartment transport ha been address by the isol of yeast invertas | suc | that caus intracellular accumul of activ | two that delai transport of core invertas | but not acid phosphatas | have been in the | code region of suc | both reduc specif the transport of invertas to compart | presum in the golgi bodi | where outer chain carbohydr is | subsequ transport to the cell surfac is not similarli | on mutat | suc | convert an ala codon to val at posit in the signal peptid | the other | suc | chang thr to an il at posit | in the matur protein | mutat result in about fold rate of invertas transport to the golgi bodi which is attribut to defect signal peptid cleavag | while peptid cleavag normal occur at an ala ser bond | the mutant form is slowli at the adjac ser posit give rise to matur invertas with an n termin | mutant invertas is transport about sevenfold more slowli than normal | with no delai in signal peptid cleavag | and no detect abnorm physical properti of the | thi substitut mai interfer with the interact of invertas and receptor that facilit transport to the golgi bodi |
