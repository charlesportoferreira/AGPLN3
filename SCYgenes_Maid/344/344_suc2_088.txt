the stabil of yeast invertas is not significantli by glycosylation | yeast invertas exist in two differ form | the cytoplasmic is nonglycosylate | wherea the extern invertas contain about | carbohydr of the high mannos type | the protein moieti of both enzyme ar ident | the two invertas have been previous as model system to investig the influenc of coval carbohydr chain on the stabil of larg glycoprotein | and controversi result | here | we thermal and denatur unfold by variou probe | such as the loss of enzymatic activ | and by the chang in absorb and fluoresc | the rang of stabil of the two invertas to be essenti ident | indic that the presenc of high amount of carbohydr doe not significantli contribut to the stabil of extern invertas | earlier find that invertas is by glycosylation could not be | the stabil of thi glycoprotein is appar by the specif interact of the fold polypeptide chain | unlik the form | the carbohydr free invertas is prone to aggreg in the state at high temperatur and in partial form in the presenc of intermedi concentr of guanidinium chlorid |
