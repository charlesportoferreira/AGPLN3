comparison of two yeast invertas gene | conserv of the upstream regulatori region | the yeast genom contain dispers famili of invertas structur gene | suc suc | suc | five of these gene ar veri close to telomer and ar flank by larg region of sequenc | recombin between telomer could account for the dispers of these suc gene to differ chromosom | the suc | in contrast | is not near and doe not share larg region of flank homolog with the other loci | we examin here the relationship between suc and on of the telomer gene | suc | sequenc comparison homolog extend from about posit to | which is close to the end of the mrna | the | noncod sequenc includ two highli region | the region between and | which contain the tata box and presum other promot element | and second region extend from to | which correspond to the upstream regulatori region |
