synthesi of saccharomyc invertas by schizosaccharomyc | in order to gain inform on the abil of the glycosylation system of schizosaccharomyc to process heterolog glycoprotein | the express of saccharomyc invertas in the former yeast | sc | cell ar abl to produc enzymatic activ invertas from the | suc gene by transform and the is and into the cell wall | howev | sc | transform do not glycosylate the heterolog as their own invertas sinc it is not by the lectin from bandeiraea simplicifolia seed | which indic the absenc of termin galactos residu | moreov | the electrophoret mobil of the heterolog invertas is similar to that of the larg from | both in it nativ form and after be with endo h | these result suggest that the polypeptide chain of | invertas is the primari factor for the glycosylation in sc | cell |
