the form of invertas in saccharomyc is from mrna encod signal sequenc | the suc gene of saccharomyc encod two differ mrna | and | kilobas | that differ at their | end | the larger rna encod | form of invertas and the smaller rna encod an intracellular | nonglycosylate form | we have the nucleotid sequenc of the amino termin code region of the suc gene and it upstream flank region and have the | end of the suc mrna rel to the dna sequenc | the | kilobas rna contain signal peptid code sequenc and presum encod precursor to invertas | the | kilobas rna doe not includ the complet code sequenc for the signal peptid | the nucleotid sequenc data prove that suc is structur gene for invertas | and translat of the code inform provid the complet amino acid sequenc of an | signal peptid |
