synergistic releas from glucos repress by mig and in saccharomyc | in the yeast saccharomyc | glucos repress of suc transcript requir the tup repressor complex | it ha been that the dna bind protein mig secur tup to the suc promot | here we show that mig delet doe not caus nearli as dramat loss of repress as | glucos grown mig mutant displai fold lower suc express than mutant | thu | repress by tup is not mediat sole by mig | but also involv mig independ mechan | we report that mig partial restor suc express in mutant lack the protein kinas and show that mig is allel to | mutat as suppressor of | other gene in thi select therefor candid for role in repress of suc | we show that mig act synergisticalli with through | and to reliev glucos repress of suc and to the requir for | these find indic that the protein contribut to repress of suc | and the pleiotrop phenotyp of the mutant suggest global role in repress | final | the suc express in mig mutant indic that signal regard glucos avail can be transmit independ of the protein kinas |
