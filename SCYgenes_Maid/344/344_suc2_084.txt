structur requir for protein n glycosylation | influenc of acceptor peptid on cotransl glycosylation of yeast invertas and site mutagenesi around sequon sequenc | to understand better the structur requir of the protein moieti import for n glycosylation | we have the influenc of prolin residu with respect to their posit around the consensu sequenc | or sequon | asn xaa ser | thr | in the first part of the paper | experi ar us cell free translat | glycosylation system from reticulocyt supplement with dog pancrea microsom to test the abil of potenti acceptor peptid to interfer with glycosylation of nascent yeast invertas chain | it that peptid | be acceptor for oligosaccharid transferas in vitro | inhibit cotransl glycosylation | wherea nonacceptor have no effect | acceptor peptid do not abolish transloc of nascent chain into the endoplasm reticulum | result with prolin contain peptid ar compat with the notion that prolin in an n termin posit of potenti glycosylation site doe not interfer with glycosylation | wherea in the posit xaa or at the termin of the sequon | prolin prevent and doe not favour oligosaccharid transfer | respect | thi statement further substanti by in vivo studi us site mutagenesi to introduc prolin at the termin of glycosylation site of invertas | express of thi mutat in three differ system | in yeast cell | frog oocyte and by cell free translat | glycosylation in reticulocyt supplement with dog pancrea microsom | lead to an inhibit of glycosylation with both qualit and quantit differ | thi mai indic that host specif factor also contribut to glycosylation |
