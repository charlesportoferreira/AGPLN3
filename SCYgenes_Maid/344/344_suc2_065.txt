yeast sko gene encod bzip protein that bind to the cre motif and act as repressor of transcript | we have yeast gene | sko | which in high copi number suppress lethal overexpress of camp depend protein kinas | sko encod bzip protein that bind to the cre motif | tgacgtca | we that sko also bind to cre like site in suc | yeast gene encod invertas which is under posit control by camp | disrupt of the sko gene caus partial derepress of suc | indic that sko is neg regul of the suc gene | sko interact posit with mig | zinc finger protein that mediat glucos repress of suc | kinet analysi complex regul of the suc mrna in respons to glucos | first | mig mediat rapid and strong repress of suc | which is complet within minut | second | mig independ process caus further slow reduct in the mrna | third | in the absenc of mig | there is also rapid but transient glucos induct of the suc mrna | thi induct is with transient loss of sko depend repress |
