nitrogen regul of saccharomyc invertas | role of the ur gene | the regul of extracellular enzyme is of great biotechnolog interest | we the regulatori role of the ur gene on the periplasm invertas of saccharomyc | becaus it periplasm asparaginas is by the ur | gln system | enzymatic activ in the isogen strain | the ur mutant | and the strain with the pic cs carri the ur gene | the assai us midlog and stationari phase cell and nitrogen cell from these growth phase | dure exponenti growth | the level of invertas in both wild type and ur mutant cell compar | howev | the invertas activ in ur mutant cell from stationari phase sixfold lower than in the wild type cell | when cell with the pic cs | the wild type phenotyp | on nitrogen starvat in the presenc of | the invertas activ in wild type cell from midlog phase three time | wherea in stationari cell | the activ eight time | howev | invertas activ in ur mutant cell from both phase | when these cell with the aforement | the wild type phenotyp | although signific invertas decreas in stationari cell not | these result that the ur protein plai role in invertas activ |
