the prefer for rich dna by the yeast protein defin of univers pair sequenc | the protein of saccharomyc is eukaryot homolog of the reca protein | the prototyp dna strand exchang protein of escherichia coli | gene function is for effici genet recombin and for dna doubl strand break repair | recent | we that reca protein ha preferenti affin for rich dna sequenc sever of which exhibit reca protein pair activ | the fundament similar between the reca and protein suggest that might displai an analog bia | us in vitro select | here we show that the yeast protein share the same prefer for rich sequenc as it prokaryot counterpart | thi bia is also manifest as an abil of protein to promot the invas of supercoil dna by rich singl strand dna | an activ not previous for the eukaryot pair protein | we propos that the prefer util of rich sequenc is featur among all homolog of reca protein | and that rich region ar loci for genet exchang in both prokaryot and eukaryot |
