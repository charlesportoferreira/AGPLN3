character of strand exchang activ of yeast protein | the saccharomyc gene product take part in genet recombin and repair of dna doubl strand break | like escherichia coli reca | catalyz strand exchang between circular singl strand dna | ssdna | and linear doubl strand dna | dsdna | in the presenc of atp and ssdna bind protein | the format of joint molecul between circular ssdna and linear dsdna is initi at either the | or the | overhang end of the complementari strand | joint molecul ar onli if the length of the overhang end is more than nucleotid | linear dsdna with recess complementari or blunt end ar not util | the polar of strand exchang depend upon which end is to initi the format of joint molecul | joint molecul via the | end ar by branch migrat in the | to | direct with respect to ssdna | and joint molecul with | end ar in the opposit direct |
