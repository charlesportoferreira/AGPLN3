rada protein is an archaeal reca protein homolog that catalyz dna strand exchang | with the discoveri that the saccharomyc protein is both structur and function similar to the escherichia coli reca protein | the reca paradigm for recombin to the eucarya | the ubiquit presenc of reca and protein homolog rais the question of whether thi archetyp protein exist within the third domain of life | the archaea | here we present the isol of | reca protein homolog from the archaeon sulfolobu solfataricu | and show that thi protein | rada | possess the characterist of dna strand exchang protein | the rada protein is dna depend atpas | form nucleoprotein filament on dna | and catalyz dna pair and strand exchang |
