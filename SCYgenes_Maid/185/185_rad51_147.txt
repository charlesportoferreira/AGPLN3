the involv of cellular recombin and repair gene in rna mediat recombin in saccharomyc | we previous that revers transcript of cellular report gene | hi ai | can serv as the donor for gene convers of chromosom hi deltamsci target sequenc | and that thi process requir the yeast recombin gene | in thi studi | we examin the involv of other recombin and repair gene in rna mediat recombin | and gain insight into the natur of the recombin intermedi | we find that mutat of the mitot reca homolog | and increas the rate of rna mediat recombin rel to the wild type | and that these gene function ar not for rna mediat gene convers | interestingli | is for rna mediat gene convers of chromosom hi deltamsci sequenc | suggest that the cdna intermedi ha region of nonhomolog that must be dure recombin with target sequenc | the observ that both and ar for rna mediat gene convers of chromosom but not sequenc indic clear differ between these two pathwai of rna mediat recombin |
