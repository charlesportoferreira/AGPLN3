interact with the evolutionarili brc motif in the human breast cancer suscept gene brca | recent work ha shown that the murin brca tumor suppressor protein interact with the murin protein | thi interact suggest that brca particip in dna repair | residu of the murin brca protein shown to be in thi interact | here | we report the detail map of addit domain that ar in interact between the human homolog of these two protein | through yeast two hybrid and biochem assai | we demonstr that the protein interact specif with the eight evolutionarili brc motif in exon of brca and with similar motif in caenorhabd elegan hypothetical protein | delet analysi demonstr that residu of human interact with the minim region that is in all brc motif | these data suggest that the brc repeat function to bind |
