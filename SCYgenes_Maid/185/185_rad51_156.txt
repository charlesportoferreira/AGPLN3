clone | sequenc | disrupt and phenotyp analysi of uvsc | an aspergillu nidulan homologu of yeast | we have the uvsc gene of aspergillu nidulan by complement of the | nidulan uvsc mutant | the protein uvsc show | sequenc ident to the saccharomyc protein and | sequenc ident to the escherichia coli reca protein | transcript of uvsc is by methyl methan sulphon | mm | as is transcript of of yeast | similar level of uvsc transcript after mm induct in uvsc | strain and the uvsc mutant | the code sequenc of the uvsc allel ha delet of bp | which result in delet of two amino acid and replac of on amino acid in the translat product | in order to gain more insight into the biolog function of the uvsc gene | uvsc null mutant | in which the entir uvsc code sequenc by select marker gene | meiotic and mitot phenotyp of uvsc | strain | the uvsc mutant and the uvsc null mutant | the uvsc null mutant more sensit to both uv and mm than the uvsc mutant | the uvsc mutant arrest in meiotic prophas i | the uvsc null mutant arrest at an earlier stage | befor the onset of meiosi | on possibl interpret of these meiotic phenotyp is that the | nidulan homologu of of yeast ha role both in the special process preced meiosi and in meiotic prophas i |
