hyper resist of meiotic cell to radiat due to strong express of singl reca like gene in caenorhabd elegan | sensit of meiotic cell to dna damag agent is littl understood | we have that the meiotic pachytene nuclei in the caenorhabd elegan gonad ar hyper resist to x rai irradi | but not to uv irradi | wherea the earli embryonic cell after fertil and the full grown oocyte ar not | the ce rdh gene | dmc | lim | homolog or ce | which is essenti for the meiotic recombin | is the onli bacteri reca like gene in the nematod genom | and is strongli in the meiotic cell | follow silenc of the ce rdh gene by rna interfer | the meiotic cell becom more sensit to x rai irradi than the earli embryonic cell | thi is the first report that meiotic cell ar hyper resist to dna strand break due to the high level of express of the | in meiotic recombin |
