construct and character of radrad doubl mutant as host for yac librari | or recombin defici yeast strain stabil otherwis unstabl yac contain ribosom dna or the human color vision | kohno et al | thu the radrad pathwai | ar appar in the instabl of yac contain tandem repeat loci | presum by promot recombin base delet format | some other genom loci ar still unstabl or unrecover in those strain | but we now find that greater stabil is in radrad doubl mutant strain that we have newli | yac contain highli unstabl region around dx or centromer region throw off varieti of product in singl mutant | but ar much more stabl in the radrad strain | which could therefor provid better host for librari construct and mainten |
