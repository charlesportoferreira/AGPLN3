the uvsc and uvs gene of aspergillu nidulan ar not for the mutagen repair of uv damag | the uvsc gene of aspergillu nidulan is homolog of the gene of saccharomyc | howev | with respect to it effect on uv mutagenesi | it differ from the yeast gene | sinc it seem to be for uv mutagenesi | howev | thi conclus is base onli on data from rest conidia | to further clarifi the function role of the uvsc gene | we the uv mutabl of strain bear uvsc mutat in rest as well as in germin conidia | by the fluorophenyl alanin resist test | we also the mutabl of the uvs mutant which belong to the same epistat group | our result show that the uvsc and uvs gene do not have signific role in the mutagen uv repair pathwai |
