format of larg palindrom dna by recombin of short invert repeat sequenc in saccharomyc | larg dna palindrom form sporad in mani eukaryot and prokaryot genom and ar often associ with gene | the presenc of short invert repeat sequenc near dna doubl strand break ha been implic in the format of larg palindrom in varieti of organ | previous we have that in saccharomyc linear dna palindrom is effici from singl copi circular when dna doubl strand break is next to short invert repeat sequenc | in thi studi we address whether the linear palindrom form by an intermolecular reaction | that is | reaction between two ident fragment in head to head arrang | or by an unusu intramolecular reaction | as it appar doe in other exampl of palindrom format | our evid support model in which palindrom ar primarili by an intermolecular reaction involv recombin of short invert repeat sequenc | we have also our investig into the requir for dna doubl strand break repair gene in palindrom format | we have that delet of the gene significantli reduc palindrom format by intermolecular recombin and that delet of two other gene in the epistasi group | and | have littl or no effect on palindrom format | in addit | palindrom format is dramat by delet of the nucleotid excis repair gene |
