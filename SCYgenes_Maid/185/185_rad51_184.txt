biolog consequ of e | coli reca protein express in the repair defect pso and | mutant of | after treatment with n methyl n | nitro n nitrosoguanidin | reca protein of e | coli is multifunct protein particip in genet recombin | recombin repair and mutagenesi | we e | coli reca gene as probe for complement of repair defect after treatment of n methyl n | nitro n nitrosoguanidin in the pso and | mutant of | we to find the role of the reca protein in | mutant defect in differ repair pathwai | the reca protein no effect on surviv of haploid and diploid pso mutant | but it signific effect on mnng mutagenesi | which to the wild type level | no effect of the reca protein on surviv in | mutant after mnng treatment | howev | in thi case the reca protein the mutagenesi | we can suppos that the reca protein | with it multifunct enzymatic activ | can bind to special intermedi and initi function of differ repair pathwai depend on repair defect of the mutant |
