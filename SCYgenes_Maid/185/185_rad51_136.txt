stimul by of yeast mediat recombin | in saccharomyc | the and gene ar in recombin and in repair of damag dna | the gene is structur and function homologu of the reca gene and the gene product particip in strand exchang and singl strand dna depend atp hydrolysi by mean of nucleoprotein filament format | the gene is import in mediat recombin | bind of thi protein to suggest that thei cooper in recombin | homologu of both and ar from yeast to human | suggest that the mechan for pair dna molecul dure recombin mai be univers in eukaryot | here we show that protein stimul reaction and that bind to is necessari for thi stimulatori effect | we conclud that thi bind is crucial in recombin and that it facilit the format of nucleoprotein filament |
