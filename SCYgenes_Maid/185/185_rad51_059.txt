mediat function of the human radb radc complex in | rpa dna strand exchang | five like protein | to as paralog | have been in vertebr | we show that two of them | radb and radc | ar associ in stabl complex | radb radc complex ha ssdna bind and ssdna atpas activ | we also the function interact of radb radc with and rpa | even though rpa enhanc dna joint format via remov of secondari structur in the ssdna substrat | it can also compet with for bind to the substrat | lead to reaction effici | the competit by rpa for substrat bind can be partial allevi by radb radc | thi recombin mediat function of radb radc is like for the assembl of the ssdna nucleoprotein filament in vivo |
