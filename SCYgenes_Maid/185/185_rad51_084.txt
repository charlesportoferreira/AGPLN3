the dna bind and pair prefer of the archaeal rada protein demonstr univers characterist of dna strand exchang protein | the archaeal rada protein is homologu of the escherichia coli reca and saccharomyc protein and possess the same biochem activ | here | us in vitro select | we show that the sulfolobu solfataricu rada protein displai the same prefer as it homologu for bind to dna sequenc that ar rich in g residu | and under in and residu | the rada protein also displai pair activ with these in vitro sequenc | these parallel between the archaeal | eukary and bacteri protein further extend the univers characterist of dna strand exchang protein |
