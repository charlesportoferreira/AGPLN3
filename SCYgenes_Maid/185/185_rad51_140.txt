base pair switch by interconvers of sugar pucker in dna by protein of reca famili | model for homolog search in genet recombin | escherichia coli reca is repres of protein from the reca famili | which promot pair and strand exchang between doubl strand dna and singl strand dna | these reaction ar essenti for genet recombin in variou organ | from nmr studi | we previous novel deoxyribose base stack interact between adjac residu on the singl strand dna to reca protein | in thi studi | we that the same dna structur by the bind to saccharomyc protein | indic that the uniqu dna structur by the bind to reca homolog from prokaryot to eukaryot | on the basi of thi structur | we have formul the structur of duplex dna within filament by reca protein and it homolog | two type of molecular structur ar | on is the duplex structur that ha the n type sugar pucker | it helic pitch is approxim | bp | turn | correspond to that of an activ | or atp form of the reca filament | the other is on that ha the type sugar pucker | it helic pitch is approxim | bp | turn | correspond to that of an inact | or adp form of the reca filament | dure thi model | we that the interconvers of sugar pucker between the n type and the type rotat base horizont | while maintain the deoxyribose base stack interact | we propos that thi base rotat enabl base pair switch between doubl strand dna and singl strand dna to take place | facilit pair and strand exchang | possibl mechan for strand exchang involv dna rotat also is discuss |
