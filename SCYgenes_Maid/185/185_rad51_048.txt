an aspergillu nidulan uvsc null mutant is defici in dna integr | the aspergillu nidulan uvsc gene as homolog of and reca of saccharomyc and escherichia coli | respect | whose role in genet recombin and recombin repair ha been extens | like mani other filament fungi | nidulan show no bia toward either or ectop integr of exogen dna | therefor it is uniqu and us organ for the studi of the mechan of dna integr | integr of | kb argb gene not in transform from uvsc null mutant | in contrast | the frequenc of integr in uvsc | control strain vari from to | anoth featur with the uvsc null mutant that an number of transform undergon ectop integr at multipl site in the genom | these result ar consist with the function of | reca | and further indic the involv of redund pathwai in integr of exogen dna | thi studi provid direct evid for the involv of uvsc in exogen dna integr and should contribut to the improv of genet manipul in gener | but particularli in fungi |
