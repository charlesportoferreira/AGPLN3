the famili member | radl | is dna atpas that form complex with xrcc | the protein in eukaryot cell is structur and function homolog of escherichia coli reca with role in dna repair and genet recombin | sever protein show sequenc similar to have previous been in both yeast and human cell | in saccharomyc | two of these protein | radp and radp | form heterodim that can stimul mediat dna strand exchang | here | we report the purif of on of the repres of the famili in human cell | we demonstr that the radl protein possess singl strand dna bind activ and dna atpas activ | consist with the presenc of quot | walker box quot | motif in the radl sequenc | we have protein complex in human cell contain radl and second famili member | xrcc | by us protein | we demonstr that the interact between radl and xrcc is direct | given the requir for xrcc in genet recombin and protect against dna damag agent | we suggest that the complex of radl and xrcc is like to be import for these function in human cell |
