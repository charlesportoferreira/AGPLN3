the dna bind properti of saccharomyc protein | saccharomyc protein is the paradigm for eukaryot atp depend dna strand exchang protein | to explain some of the uniqu characterist of dna strand exchang by protein | when with it prokaryot homologu the escherichia coli reca protein | we the dna bind properti of the protein | protein bind both singl strand dna | ssdna | and doubl strand dna | dsdna | in an atp and mg | depend manner | over wide rang of ph | with an appar bind stoichiometri of approxim protein monom per | nucleotid or base pair | respect | onli datp and adenosin | gamma | thiotriphosph | atpgamma | can substitut for atp | but bind in the presenc of atpgamma requir more than fold stoichiometr excess of protein | without nucleotid cofactor | protein bind both ssdna and dsdna but onli at ph valu lower than | in thi case | the appar bind stoichiometri cover the rang of protein monom per nucleotid or base pair | therefor | protein displai two distinct mode of dna bind | these bind mode ar not inter convert | howev | their initi select is govern by atp bind | on the basi of these dna bind properti | we conclud that the main reason for the low effici of the dna strand exchang by protein in vitro is it dsdna bind abil | which inhibit both the presynaptic and synaptic phase of the dna strand exchang reaction as follow | dure presynapsi | protein interact with and stabil secondari structur in ssdna therebi inhibit format of contigu nucleoprotein filament | dure synapsi | protein inactiv the dsdna partner by directli bind to it |
