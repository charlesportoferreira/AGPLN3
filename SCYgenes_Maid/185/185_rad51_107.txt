human amino acid residu for bind | the protein | homologu of the bacteri reca protein | is an essenti factor for both meiotic and mitot recombin | the n termin domain of the human protein | hsrad | directli interact with dna | base on yeast two hybrid analysi | it ha been that the n termin region of the saccharomyc protein bind | and both activ the pair and strand exchang reaction | here | we show that the hsrad n termin region | which correspond to the bind region of scrad | doe not exhibit strong bind to the human protein | hsrad | to investig it function | the termin region of hsrad randomli mutagen | although thi region includ the two segment correspond to the put dna bind site of reca | all seven of the mutant not decreas | but instead slightli | the dna bind | in contrast | we that some of these hsrad significantli the hsrad bind | therefor | we conclud that these amino acid residu ar for the hsrad | hsrad bind | hsrad | as well as | pair between ssdna and dsdna | and higher pair activ in the presenc of both hsrad and hsrad than with either hsrad or hsrad alon | the hsrad fv mutat | which strongli impair the hsrad bind | the pair in the presenc of both hsrad and hsrad | without affect the pair by hsrad alon | thi result suggest the import of the hsrad | hsrad interact in pair | copyright academ press |
