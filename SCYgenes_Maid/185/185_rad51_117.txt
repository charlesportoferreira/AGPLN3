character of the role by the gene of saccharomyc in ectop recombin | the group of gene in the yeast saccharomyc control the repair of dna damag by recombin mechan | despit the grow evid for physical and biochem interact between the protein of thi repair group | in individu gene show veri differ effect on variou type of recombin | the gene encod protein with similar to radp which plai role in the repair of damag by ioniz radiat | in the present studi we have the role by the protein in mitot ectop recombin and the genet interact with other member of the repair group | we that radp plai role in ectop gene convers that depend on the presenc of radp but is independ of the function of the reca homologu radp and of the protein | the gene product also particip in the depend pathwai of recombin between direct repeat | we propos that radp mai act in salvag mechan that oper when the filament is not function |
