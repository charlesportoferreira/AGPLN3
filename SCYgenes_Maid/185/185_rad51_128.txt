dna strand exchang protein | biochem and physical comparison | genet recombin is an essenti biolog process that involv the pair and exchang of dna between two chromosom or dna molecul | it is of fundament import to the preserv of genom integr | the product of genet divers | and the proper segreg of chromosom | in escherichia coli | the reca protein is essenti to recombin | and biochem analysi demonstr that it is respons for the crucial step of pair and dna strand exchang | the presenc of reca like protein | or their function equival | in bacteriophag | other eubacteria | archaea | and eukaryot | confirm that the mechan of pair and dna strand exchang is throughout all form of life | thi review focus on the biochem and physical characterist of dna strand exchang protein from three divers organ | reca protein from e | coli | uvsx protein from bacteriophag t | and protein from saccharomyc |
