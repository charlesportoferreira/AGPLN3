the mous and human homolog of dmc | the yeast meiosi specif recombin gene | have common uniqu form of exon skip transcript in meiosi | genet recombin in meiosi plai an import role in gener divers of genet inform | in yeast an escherichia coli reca like gene | dmc | is in meiotic prophas and it product co local with protein on zygotene chromosom | we have the mous and human homolog of the yeast dmc gene | the human and mous dmc protein | sequenc ident with yeast dmc protein | the domain ii region | highli in the e | coli reca like protein famili | also in the mammalian dmc protein | includ the two atp bind motif and dna bind site with the region | in situ hybridization analysi express of the mous dmc gene in testicular germ cell in meiosi | rt pcr express in embryonal ovari | these find suggest that dmc plai an import role in meiotic recombin | from both the man and mous we have an altern form of dmc cdna | dmc d | which is for region between the two motif in nucleotid bind | sinc the altern dmc d transcript in both male and femal germ cell | the protein dmc d mai have novel role in mammalian genet recombin in meiosi |
