novel nucleic acid bind protein that interact with human recombinas | us the yeast two hybrid system | we cdna encod novel human protein | pir | that strongli interact with human recombinas | analysi in vitro the interact between and pir | pir mrna is in number of human organ | most notabl in testi | thymu | colon and small intestin | the pir gene to chromosom | by fluoresc in situ hybridization | the pir protein in escherichia coli and to near homogen | biochem analysi show that the pir protein bind both singl and doubl strand dna | and is capabl of aggreg dna | the protein also bind rna | the pir protein mai repres new member of the multiprotein complex to carri out recombin and dna repair in mammalian cell |
