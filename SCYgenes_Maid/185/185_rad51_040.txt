escherichia coli reco protein anneal ssdna complex with it cognat ssdna bind protein | common step in genet recombin | we present biochem evid for the function similar of escherichia coli reco protein and bacteriophag t uvsi protein to eukaryot protein | although protein is in eukaryot | no sequenc homologu ha been in prokaryot or archeabacteria | protein ha two uniqu activ | facilit of replic protein | rpa | displac by protein and anneal of rpa singl strand dna | ssdna | complex | both activ requir speci specif interact between protein and rpa | both reco and uvsi protein also possess the former properti with regard to their cognat ssdna bind protein | here | we report that reco protein anneal ssdna that is complex with onli it cognat ssdna bind protein | suggest the involv of speci specif interact | optim activ for reco protein occur after format of | complex with ssb protein | recr protein | which is known to stimul reco protein to facilit ssb protein displac by reca protein | inhibit anneal by reco protein | suggest that recr protein mai regul the choic between the dna strand invas versu anneal pathwai | in addit | we show that uvsi protein anneal ssdna | furthermor | ssdna | which is complex onli with it cognat ssdna bind protein | is anneal in the presenc of uvsi protein | these result indic that reco and possibl uvsi protein ar function counterpart of protein | base on the conserv of these function | we propos modifi doubl strand break repair model that includ dna anneal as an import intermedi step |
