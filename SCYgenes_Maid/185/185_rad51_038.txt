structur of reaction intermedi dure saccharomyc strand transfer | the process by which the saccharomyc strand transfer protein | seek out sequenc in vivo can be model by an in vitro reaction between singl strand dna circl and doubl strand linear dna | in addit to the substrat and product | electrophoresi of reaction mixtur resolv two group of low mobil band | here we show that the low mobil band dure strand transfer by | or escherichia coli reca | repres joint molecul | jm | between the two substrat | on group | which we name jm | is an obligatori reaction intermedi in which the complementari strand from the duplex substrat ha been partial transfer to the singl strand circl | our assign is base on puls chase and restrict digest experi and verifi by electron microscopi | the slower move group of band | jm | is by an unexpect reaction between jm and second doubl strand linear substrat | strand transfer of the second duplex initi noncanon from the end where the complementari strand is recess | thu jm is by two strand transfer reaction with the same singl strand circular substrat but with opposit polar | final | we show that the multipl sharp band in jm and jm ar the result of substrat sequenc that paus strand transfer |
