specif interact between dna polymerase ii | pold | and radb | dmc homolog | in pyrococcu furiosu | pyrococcu furiosu ha an operon contain the dna polymerase ii | pold | gene and three other gene | us two hybrid screen to examin the interact of the protein by the operon | we specif interact between the second subunit of pold | dp | and | dmc protein | radb | to ensur the specif interact between these two protein | each gene in the operon in escherichia coli or insect cell separ and the product | the in vitro analys us the protein also the interact between dp and radb | the delet mutant analysi of dp that region import for bind with radb is in the central part of the sequenc | amino acid residu | thi region ha an overlap to the termin half | amino acid | which is highli among euryarchaeal dp and is essenti for the activ of pold | our result suggest that | although radb doe not notic affect the primer extens abil of pold in vitro | pold mai util the radb protein in dna synthesi under certain condit |
