sequenc prefer in dna bind among recombin protein | an effect of ssdna secondari structur | repetit sequenc have been to be recombinogen element in eukaryot chromosom | we whether dinucleotid repeat sequenc ar preferenti site for recombin becaus of their high affin for recombin enzyme | we the kinet of the bind of the scrad | hsrad and ecreca protein to oligonucleotid with repeat of dinucleotid | ca | ct | ga | gc or at | sinc secondari structur in singl strand dna | ssdna | act as barrier to complet bind we whether these oligonucleotid ar abl to form stabl secondari structur | we show that the preferenti bind of recombin protein is among the three protein and is mainli by secondari structur in ssdna |
