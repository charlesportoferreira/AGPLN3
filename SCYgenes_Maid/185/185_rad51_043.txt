transcript and doubl strand break induc similar mitot recombin event in saccharomyc | we have compar analysi of doubl strand break | dsb | recombin and spontan recombin under low and high transcript condit in yeast | we two differ recombin substrat | on for the analysi of intermolecular gene convers and the other for intramolecular gene convers and invers | such substrat base on the same leu hor allel to the tet promot and contain bp ho site | gene convers and invers differ by | and singl and doubl | consist with the actual view that such event occur by differ recombin mechan | howev | the effect of each mutat on each type of recombin event the same | whether associ with transcript or by the ho mediat dsb | both the highli transcrib dna and the ho sequenc as recipi of the gene convers event | these result ar consist with the hypothesi that transcript promot initi of recombin along the dna sequenc be transcrib | the similar between transcript associ and dsb recombin suggest that transcript promot dna break |
