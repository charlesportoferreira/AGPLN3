dna photodamag | repair | gene induct and genotox follow exposur to nm uv and methoxypsoralen plu uva in eukaryot cell system | the induct and repair of differ type of photodamag and photogenotox in eukaryot cell have been the subject of mani studi | littl is known about possibl link between these phenomena and the induct of dna damag induc gene | we thi relationship us the yeast saccharomyc | pertin eukaryot model | previou result that the photogenotox potenti of methoxypsoralen | mop | plu uva is higher than that of uv | nm | moreov | the induct of the ribonucleotid reductas gene rnr by uv and mop plu uva in an rnr lacz fusion strain and the format of dna doubl strand break | dsb | as repair intermedi after such treatment suggest that the latter process could involv signal for gene induct | to further substanti thi | we the induct of the dna repair gene in lacz fusion strain us the dsb repair and recombin defici mutant and the correspond wild type | and we the format of dsb by puls field gel electrophoresi | after treatment | the reseal of dsb as repair intermedi impair in the mutant | at equal dose | i | e | the same number of lesion | the induct of the gene by uv or mop plu uva significantli in the mutant as with the wild type | the same true when equitox dose | thu | the repair pathwai appear to plai an import role not onli in dsb repair but also in gene induct | furthermor | the signal pathwai initi by dna damag and it process ar somewhat to the photogenotox respons |
