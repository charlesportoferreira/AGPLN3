character of two highli similar homolog of physcomitrella paten | the moss physcomitrella paten | which is land plant with effici recombin | encod two protein | pparad | and pparad | the pparad | and pparad | protein | which share | ident between them | interact with themselv and with each other | both protein bind ssdna and dsdna in mg | and ph depend manner | with stoichiometri of on pparad | monom per | nt or bp and on pparad | monom per | nt or bp | respect | at neutral ph | fold excess of both protein is for ssdna and dsdna bind | pparad | and pparad | show ssdna depend atpas activ and effici promot strand anneal in nucleotid independ but in mg | depend manner | both protein promot joint molecul format | dna strand invas and ar abl to catalys strand exchang in the presenc of mg | and atp | no further increas in the activ is when both protein ar present in the same reaction | none of the pparad gene product complement the dna repair and recombin phenotyp of saccharomyc raddelta mutant | howev | pparad | confer domin neg dna repair phenotyp | and both pparad protein reduc the level of doubl strand break recombin when in | wt cell | these result suggest that both pparad protein ar bona fide protein that mai contribut | in differ manner | to recombin | and that thei might replac scrad in hypothetical yeast protein complex inactiv differ function for recombin repair | copyright elsevi scienc ltd |
