equal sister chromatid exchang is major mechan of doubl strand break repair in yeast | equal sister chromatid exchang | sce | ha been to be an import mechan of doubl strand break | dsb | repair in eukaryot | but thi ha never been proven due to the difficulti of distinguish sce product from parent molecul | to evalu the biolog relev of equal sce in dsb repair and to understand the underli molecular mechan | we recombin substrat for the analysi of dsb repair by sce in yeast | in these substrat | most break ar limit to on chromatid | allow the intact sister chromatid to serv as the repair templat | both equal and unequ sce can be | we show that equal sce is major mechan of dsb repair | is depend | and is by and | our work provid physical analysi of mitot occur sce in vivo and open new perspect for the studi and understand of dsb repair in eukaryot |
