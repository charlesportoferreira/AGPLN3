investig of the stabil of yeast mutant protein uncov post translat and transcript regul of radp | we the stabil of the saccharomyc protein to learn how cell control it quantiti and longev | we the cellular level of wild type and mutant form of radp when from the promot and the half live of the variou form of radp when from the gal promot | the wild type protein ha half life of min | variabl affect the cellular level of the protein product | and these level correl with the half live | while missens in the n terminu of the protein drastic reduc the cellular level of the mutant protein | two on delet of amino acid and the other missens mutat of increas the cellular level and half life more than twofold | these result suggest that radp is subject to post translat regul | proteasom have no effect on radp half life but increas the amount of messag | in contrast to radp | the half life of radp is | hr | and express is unaffect by proteasom | these differ between radp and radp suggest differenti regul of two protein that interact in recombin repair |
