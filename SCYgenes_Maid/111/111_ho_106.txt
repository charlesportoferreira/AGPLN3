activ of yeast replic origin near doubl strand dna break | irradi in the g phase of the cell cycle delai the onset of dna synthesi and transient inhibit the activ of replic origin in mammalian cell | it ha been that thi inhibit is the result of the loss of torsion tension in the dna after it ha been damag | becaus irradi caus dna damag at an undefin number of nonspecif site in the genom | it is not known how cell respond to limit dna damag | and how replic origin in the immedi vicin of damag site would behav | us the sequenc specif ho endonucleas | we have doubl strand dna break in centromer in g arrest cell of the yeast saccharomyc | we show that replic doe initi at the origin on the | and that the replic earli in the phase after linear in vivo | these observ suggest that relax of supercoil dna domain in yeast need not inactiv replic origin within that domain | furthermor | these observ rule out the possibl that the late replic context associ with chromosom termini is consequ of dna end |
