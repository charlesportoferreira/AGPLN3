cell cycle regul of novel dna bind complex in saccharomyc with ef like properti | us biochem approach | we have an activ in saccharomyc extract that displai the same dna bind specif as the mammalian ef transcript factor and interact with tttcgcgc promot element | addit studi that thi factor | scela | ef like activ | also bind to the close scb promot sequenc | scb site | consensu | tttcgtg | ar in the cell cycle regul of sever | cyclin gene and have been shown to interact with the heterodimer yeast complex | howev | genet studi clearli demonstr that scela is not to or | these experi impli that scb site ar abl to interact with at least two activ | and scela | becaus scb site ar critic for the period activ of cell cycle gene | we whether scela is dure yeast cell cycle | emploi temperatur sensit strain | we abl to demonstr that the dna bind activ of scela oscil dure the cell cycle and reach it maximum at the transit between the g and phase | preliminari studi suggest that thi fluctuat is mediat by phosphoryl | dephosphoryl event | further character of scela by uv cross link experi indic molecular mass of kda for thi activ | in addit | we present evid strongli suggest that scela is actual the dna bind moieti of larg kda protein complex | togeth | these studi firmli indic that scela | as part of larger complex | plai critic role in cell cycle regul of scb contain gene | such as cln cyclin and ho endonucleas | thi hypothesi is consist with other studi that conclud that the scb mediat cell cycle oscil of cln cyclin and ho requir activ that ar distinct from | final | it is worth mention that the similar between scela and ef | which is crucial compon in mammalian cell cycle regul | extend well beyond the dna bind specif | in analog to ef | scela oscil dure the cell cycle | interact with other cellular activ | and bind to promot element that ar known mediat of cell cycle control | we will discuss possibl function for scela in yeast cell cycle regul and it relationship to ef |
