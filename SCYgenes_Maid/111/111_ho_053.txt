novel mutat impair process of doubl strand break of dna dure both mitosi and meiosi | us complement test and nucleotid sequenc | we that the mutat an allel of the gene and have renam the mutat | two amino acid chang from the wild type sequenc | on is at site of phosphodiesteras motif | and the other is amino acid chang at nonconserv site | unlik null | the mutat meiosi specif doubl strand dna break | dsb | to form at recombin hot spot but to process those break | dsb end of thi mutant resist to exonucleas treatment | these phenotyp ar similar to those of rad mutant | in contrast to rad | howev | highli sensit to methyl methanesulfon treatment | dsb end process by ho endonucleas in both and the disrupt mutant | we new mutant that contain onli the phosphodiesteras motif mutat of the protein and it | thi mutant the same phenotyp in | suggest that the phosphodiesteras consensu sequenc is import for nucleolyt process of dsb end dure both mitosi and meiosi |
