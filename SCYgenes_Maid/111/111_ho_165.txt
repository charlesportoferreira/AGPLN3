the mother daughter mate type switch asymmetri of bud yeast is not by the segreg of parent ho gene dna strand | the saccharomyc ho gene | which encod site specif endonucleas | is transcrib in the parent | mother | cell but not in the daughter | bud | cell | consequ mother cell can switch their mate type wherea bud cell cannot | whether or not the differ capabl of these cell ar due to nonrandom segreg of parent ho gene dna strand to progeni cell is here by assai the pattern of switch in cell where the ho gene is invert in the chromosom | in an invert ho strain | as is the case with the normal ho arrang strain | onli the mother cell to switch | thu | the possibl of asymmetric segreg of parent ho gene dna strand doe not regul the mother daughter asymmetri of switch |
