homothal mate type switch gener lethal chromosom break in strain of saccharomyc | in homothal cell of saccharomyc | or alpha mate type inform at the mate type | mat | is by the transposit of the opposit mate type allel from hml alpha or hmra | the mutat | which reduc mitot and abolish meiotic recombin | also affect homothal switch | malon and esposito | proc | natl | acad | sci | u | we have that both ho mata and ho mat alpha cell die | thi lethal is by that substanti reduc but do not elimin homothal convers | these map at or near the mat | mat alpha inc | mata inc | mata | or ar unlink to mat | ho and | these result suggest that the switch event itself is in the lethal | with the except of | ho strain carri on of the abov cannot convert mate type at all | mat alpha ho strain appar can switch mat alpha to mata | howev | when we these mater | we that few | if ani | of them bona fide mata cell | these like cell instead either for part of chromosom iii distal to and includ mat or the entir third chromosom | approxim | of the time | an like cell could be repair to normal mata genotyp if the cell mate to mat alpha inc strain | the effect of also in mata | mat alpha inc | ho | ho diploid | when thi diploid to switch mata to mata | an unstabl broken chromosom in nearli everi cell | these studi suggest that homothal switch involv the format of doubl strand deoxyribonucleic acid break or structur which is labil in cell and result in broken chromosom | we propos that the product of doubl strand deoxyribonucleic acid break is the lethal event in ho cell |
