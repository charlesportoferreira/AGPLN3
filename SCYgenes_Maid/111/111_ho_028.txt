ho endonucleas recombin in yeast meiosi resembl spo event | in meiosi | gene convers ar accompani by higher level of cross over than in mitot cell | to determin whether the special properti of meiotic recombin can be attribut to the wai in which spop creat doubl strand break | dsb | at special hot spot in saccharomyc | we the site specif ho endonucleas in meiotic cell | we could therefor compar ho recombin in well region both in mitosi and meiosi | as well as compar spop and ho meiotic event | ho gene convers in meiosi accompani by crossov at the same high level | as spop event | moreov | ho crossov fold by mshdelta mutat that similarli affect spop event | in spodelta diploid | where the onli dsb is by ho | cross over significantli higher | than in mitot cell | lt | thi singl meiotic dsb to induc the format of synaptonemal complex | we also show that ho gene convers tract length ar shorter in meiotic than in mitot cell | we conclud that hallmark of meiotic recombin | the product of crossov | is independ of the natur of spop dsb at special hotspot | but some function of spop ar in tran to achiev maximum cross over |
