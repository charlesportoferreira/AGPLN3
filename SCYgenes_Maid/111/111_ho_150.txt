coconvers of flank sequenc with homothal switch | homothal switch in | involv replac the dna of the allel at the mate type | mat | with duplic of sequenc from the unexpress loci hml or hmr | the mata and mat alpha allel differ by dna substitut that is flank by sequenc in common to mat | and the donor loci hml and hmr | us restrict site polymorphism between mat and the donor loci | we demonstr that the extent of mat dna that is dure switch is variabl and that there is of coconvers across the x region | coconvers event occur on both side of the doubl strand cleavag by the ho gene product | the two cell after switch often differ at the flank site | indic dna heteroduplex intermedi |
