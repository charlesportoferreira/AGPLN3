yeast vector for integr at the ho | we have new yeast vector for target integr of desir sequenc at the saccharomyc ho | insert at ho ha been shown to have no effect on yeast growth | and thu these integr should be neutral | on vector contain the kanmx select marker | and integr can be by resist to g | the other vector contain the hisg hisg cassett | and integr can be by uracil prototrophi | subsequ growth on foa permit identif of coloni where recombin between the hisg tandem repeat ha to loss of the marker and return to uracil auxotrophi | we also describ sever new bacteri polylinker vector from puc | ampicillin resist | and puk | kanamycin resist |
