tn deriv that can be to make short in frame insert within gene | tn deriv to make small in frame insert within gene | the transposon contain the gene | the teta gene | lacz | and phage loxp recombin site at either end | insert that have lacz to an open read frame ar lac | becaus thei express the lacz | in the presenc of the phage cyclization recombinas cre | the transposon can delet the | teta | and lacz gene between the two loxp site | the remain short imperfect palindrom contain the end of tn and loxp site and doe not contain translat termin codon in the correct read frame | we have sever insert within the yeast ho gene | sever insert inactiv ho and prohibit initi of mate type switch | in contrast | an epitop in the central portion encod function ho endonucleas |
