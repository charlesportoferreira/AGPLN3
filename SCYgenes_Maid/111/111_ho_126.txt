character of doubl strand break recombin | homolog requir and singl strand dna format | in the yeast saccharomyc | doubl strand chromosom break by the ho endonucleas is frequent repair in mitot grow cell by recombin between flank region | produc delet | we that singl strand region on both side of the doubl strand break prior to the format of the product | the kinet of the singl strand dna in strain with the recombin defici and as well as in the wild type strain | in mutant | singl strand dna at slower rate than in the wild type | wherea mutant singl strand dna at faster rate | product format larg in the mutant | in the doubl mutant | the effect superimpos in that the exonucleolyt activ slow but product format | appear to act befor or at the same stage as | we strain contain two segment on on side of the ho site and on region on the other side to character how flank repeat find each other | delet preterenti between the region closest to the doubl strand break | by vari the size of the middl segment | we that recombin initi by doubl strand break requir minimum length between and bp | in these competit experi | the frequenc of recombin depend on the length of homolog in an approxim linear manner |
