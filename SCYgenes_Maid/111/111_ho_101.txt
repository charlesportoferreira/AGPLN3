saccharomyc allel temperatur sensit for the repair of dna doubl strand break | we have for of the saccharomyc gene which confer temperatur sensit | ts | phenotyp with respect to either the repair of dna lesion by methyl methanesulfon | mm | or the recombin of an intrachromosom recombin report | we readili abl to isol allel ts for the repair of lesion by mm but unabl to find allel with sever ts defici in intrachromosom recombin | we extens four strain confer ts growth on mm agar | these strain also exhibit ts surviv when expos to gamma radiat or when the ho endonucleas is constitut | although none of the four allel confer sever ts defect in intrachromosom recombin | two confer signific defect in test of mitot | interchromosom recombin out in diploid strain | the mutant diploid sporul | but the two strain with defect in interchromosom recombin have spore viabil | meiotic recombin is not depress in the two diploid with spore viabil | thu | in the two strain with spore viabil | defect in mitot and meiotic recombin do not correl | sequenc analysi that in three of the four ts allel the caus ar in the first on third of the open read frame while the fourth is in the termin third |
