associ of yeast sin with the tetratrico peptid repeat of cdc | the yeast sin protein is nuclear protein that togeth with other protein behav as transcript repressor of famili of gene | in addit | sin mutant ar defect in proper mitot chromosom segreg | in an effort to understand the basi for these phenotyp | we the yeast two hybrid system to identifi protein that interact with sin in vivo | here we demonstr that cdc | protein known to be in sister chromatid separ dure mitosi | is abl to directli interact with sin | furthermor | us recombin molecul in vitro | we show that the n termin of sin is suffici to bind portion of cdc consist sole of tetratrico peptid repeat | earlier experi the termin domain of sin to be respons for interact with protein that bind the regulatori region of ho | gene whose transcript is by sin | taken togeth with the result here | we suggest that sin is chromatin protein have at least dual function | the n termin of sin interact with the tetratrico peptid repeat domain of cdc | protein in chromosom segreg | wherea the termin of sin bind protein in transcript regul |
