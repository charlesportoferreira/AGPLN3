quantit analysi of yeast gene function us competit experi in continu cultur | on possibl rout to the evalu of gene function is quantit approach base on the concept of metabol control analysi | mca | an import first step in such an analysi is to determin the effect of delet individu gene on the growth rate | or fit | of | sinc the specif growth rate effect of most gene ar like to be small | we competit experi in chemostat cultur to measur the proport of delet mutant rel to that of standard strain by us quantit pcr method | in thi paper | we show that both densitometri and genescan analysi can be with similar accuraci and reproduc to determin the proport of | at least | two strain simultan | in the rang | of the total cell popul | furthermor | we report on model competit experi between two diploid nuclear petit mutant | homozyg for delet in the coxa or pet gene | and the standard strain | ho | kanmx | ho | kanmx | in chemostat cultur under six differ physiological condit | the result indic that competit experi is continu cultur ar suitabl method to distinguish quantit between delet mutant that qualit exhibit the same phenotyp |
