neg regul of ho transcript | sin | spt | is nonspecif dna bind protein to hmg | the sin gene initi becaus in sin the need for to activ transcript of the yeast ho gene | we show here that transcript of ho in sin cell effici util the normal start site | we have sin and that it is ident to the previous gene spt | in which allow transcript from certain regulatori region | the sin | spt protein ha distinct amino acid composit | residu | basic and | acid | and ha similar to the mammalian hmg protein | nonhiston compon of chromatin | we show that sin is concentr in the nucleu and bind to dna with littl or no sequenc specif in vitro | it thu exhibit properti of an hmg protein | addit of random dna segment to test promot alter regul by sin in manner similar to addit of segment from the ho upstream region | function analysi of certain sin suggest that sin mai be part of multiprotein complex | on the basi of these result | we propos that sin is nonhiston compon of chromatin which creat the proper context for transcript | becaus sin mutant exhibit loss of chromosom iii | sin mai also plai role in fidel of chromosom segreg |
