character of short uniqu sequenc in the yeast ho gene promot that regul ho transcript in sin depend manner | recent it ha becom clear that gener chromatin protein as well as sequenc specif dna bind protein ar import in the control of gene express | sin in saccharomyc is chromatin compon that regul the transcript of famili of gene | previous | we bp uniqu sequenc | here xb | in the promot of on of those gene | ho | which specif bind protein that interact with sin | we also that thi sequenc can function as weak ua in heterolog promot that is depend on the presenc of sin | here we report relationship between the level of ho express and the presenc of the short sequenc in situ in the ho gene | by compar the express of ho from wild type or xb ho promot | we that xb serv as weak ua in situ in the ho gene | that it influenc ho transcript via the | complex | and that sequenc other than the xb mediat the effect of sin on ho transcript | in addit | we show that portion of the sin protein that ha sequenc similar to mammalian hmg preferenti bind the xb |
