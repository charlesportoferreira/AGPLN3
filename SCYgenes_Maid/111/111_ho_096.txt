the termin domain of sin in yeast interact with protein that bind the ur region of the yeast ho gene | protein or protein complex ha previous been in saccharomyc which both bind short dna sequenc in ur of ho and interact with sin | sin | which ha some sequenc similar to mammalian hmg | is an abund chromatin protein in yeast and is to particip in the transcript repress of specif famili of gene | sin bind dna weakli | though it ha no dna bind specif | here we address the natur of the interact between sin and the specif dna bind protein | to ho dna | we show that the termin region of sin can interact in vitro with the dna bind protein | caus supershift in gel mobil shift assai | interestingli | inclus of the region in sin which contain two acid sequenc | preclud the bind of recombin protein to the dna | protein complex |
