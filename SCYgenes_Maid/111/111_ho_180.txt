the regul of yeast mate type chromatin structur by sir | an action at distanc affect both transcript and transposit | the two yeast mate type allel mata and mat alpha each produc two mrna that ar transcrib in opposit and diverg direct from central promot | silent copi of mata | hmra | and mat alpha | hml alpha | contain ident dna sequenc throughout the transcrib region | yet ar not transcrib | except in sir strain | sinc sir repress not onli transcript from silent copi but also it abil to act as recipi in mate type interconvers | we have whether it might act by regul the entir chromatin structur of silent | we have therefor the profil of dnaas i and micrococc nucleas cleavag at hml alpha with mat alpha and hmra with mata in sir and sir | strain | we find that sir is necessari for the mainten of differ chromatin structur at hm loci from their activ counterpart at mat | on particularli strike chang that sir induc provid simpl explan for on of it biolog properti | control of direction of switch | sir caus the disappear of dnaas i site at y z boundari | at mat or hm sir | that is coincid with doubl strand cleavag possibl by ho in the initi of mate type switch |
