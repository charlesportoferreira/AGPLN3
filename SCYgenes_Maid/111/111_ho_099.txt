function analysi of the abf bind site within the ya region of the mata and hmra loci of saccharomyc | cell type in the yeast saccharomyc is by inform present at the mat | cell can switch mate type when cell type inform at silent | hml or hmr | is transpos to the mat | the hml and hmr loci ar silent through the action of number of protein | on of which is the dna bind protein | abf | we have bind site for abf within the ya region of mata and hmra | in order to examin the function of thi abf bind site | we have strain that lack the site in the mata or hmra loci | consist with the idea that abf plai redund role in silenc | it that tripl delet of the abf bind site at hmre | ya and i not permit the express of hmra | we have also shown that chromosom delet of the bind site at matya no effect on the level of cut by the ho endonucleas nor on the amount of mate type switch | similarli | chromosom delet of all three abf bind site at hmra no effect on the direction of mate type switch |
