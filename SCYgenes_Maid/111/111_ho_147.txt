in vitro regul of sin depend dna bind activ by stimulatori and inhibitori factor | the yeast sin gene | also known as sdii | is known neg regul of the yeast ho gene | dna bind activ | sdp | which bind to the ho promot | is absent in extract from sin mutant and ha been to function as repressor | we show that sin doe not sdp and that sdp dna bind activ is in vitro by two factor | an inhibitori factor | i sdp | and stimulatori factor | sdp | i sdp act as an in vitro inhibitor of the sdp dna bind activ | restor of the dna bind activ is achiev by inclus of stimulatori factor | sdp | which copurifi with the sin protein | sdp dna bind activ by treat protein fraction contain sdp and i sdp with the dissoci agent formamid |
