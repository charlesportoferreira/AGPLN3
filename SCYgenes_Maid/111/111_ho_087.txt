in two ku homolog defin dna end join repair pathwai in saccharomyc | dna doubl strand break | dsb | repair in mammalian cell is depend on the ku dna bind protein complex | howev | the mechan of ku mediat repair is not understood | we saccharomyc gene | ku | that is structur similar to the kda mammalian ku subunit | kuo associ with the product of the hdf gene | form the major dna end bind complex of yeast cell | dna end bind absent in kudelta | hdfdelta | or kudelta hdfdelta strain | antisera specif for epitop tag on ku and hdf in supershift and immunodeplet experi to show that both protein ar directli in dna end bind | in vivo | the effici of two dna end join process | fold in kuodelta | hdfldelta | or kudelta hdfdelta strain | repair of linear dna and repair of an ho endonucleas chromosom dsb | these dna join defect with dna damag sensit | becaus kudelta and hdfdelta strain also sensit to methylmethane sulfon | mm | ku depend repair is distinct from recombin | becaus delet of ku and hdf the mm sensit of raddelta | interestingli | radodelta | also shown here to be defect in end join | epistat with ku for mm repair and end join | therefor | ku and particip in an end join pathwai that is distinct from recombin repair | yeast dna end join is function analog to dsb repair and v | d | j recombin in mammalian cell |
