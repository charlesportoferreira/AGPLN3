identif of new mediat subunit in the rna polymerase ii holoenzym from saccharomyc | mediat from yeast on the basi of it requir for transcript activ in fulli system | we have now three new member of mediat in the low molecular mass rang by peptid sequenc determin | these ar the product of the nut | cse | and med gene | the product of the nut gene is evid compon of mediat as well | nut and nut earlier as neg regul of the ho promot | wherea in cse affect chromosom segreg | med is previous uncharacter gene | the exist of these protein in the mediat complex verifi by copurif and co immunoprecipit with rna polymerase ii holoenzym |
