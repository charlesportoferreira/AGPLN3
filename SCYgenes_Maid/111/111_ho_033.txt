role of yeast sir gene and mate type in direct dna doubl strand break to and non repair path | eukaryot have mani mechan to repair dna doubl strand break | dsb | in the yeast saccharomyc | thi damag can be repair either by recombin | which depend on the protein | or by non end join | nhej | which depend on the protein yku and yku | how do cell choos which repair pathwai to us | delet of the sir | sir and sir gene which ar in transcript silenc at telomer and hm mate type loci | hmlalpha and hmra | in yeast | have been to reduc nhej as sever as delet of gene encod ku protein | here | we report that the effect of delet sir gene is larg attribut to derepress of silent mate type gene | although sir protein do plai minor role in end join | when dsb on chromosom in haploid cell that retain their mate type | sir delta mutant the frequenc of nhej by twofold or threefold | although end join not | in diploid cell | sir mutant twofold reduct in the frequenc of nhej in two assai | mate type also the effici of dsb recombin | in mata | matalpha diploid cell | dsb by ho endonucleas repair | of the time by gene convers with the chromosom | wherea in diploid cell with an alpha mate type | matdelta | matalpha | repair onli | of the time | mate type regul of gene specif to haploid or diploid cell plai kei role in determin which pathwai ar to repair dsb |
