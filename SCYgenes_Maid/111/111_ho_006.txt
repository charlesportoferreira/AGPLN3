dna damag respons mediat degrad of ho endonucleas via the ubiquitin system involv it nuclear export | yeast mate switch ho endonucleas is rapidli by the ubiquitin system and thi depend on the dna damag respons function | mec | and chk | pest sequenc mark ho for degrad | here we show that the novel f box receptor | ufo | recruit ho for degrad | mutat of pest threonin stabil ho | yet hota still bind ufo in vitro | stabl hota accumul within the nucleu | wherea hote is | delet of the nuclear exportin msn trap nativ ho in the nucleu and extend it half life | these experi suggest that ho is in the cytoplasm | in mec mutant stabl ho accumul within the nucleu | ho in mec cell doe not bind ufo | thu the mec pathwai ha function both in phosphoryl of thr for nuclear export and in addit phosphoryl for bind ufo | cell with ho under it genom promot | but by delet of the msn exportin | prolifer | but ar multibud | these experi elucid some of the link between the dna damag respons and degrad of ho by the ubiquitin system |
