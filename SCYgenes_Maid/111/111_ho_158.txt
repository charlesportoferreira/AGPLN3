physical monitor of mate type switch in saccharomyc | the kinet of mate type switch in saccharomyc can be at the dna level by us galactos induc ho | gal ho | gene to initi the event in synchronousli grow cell | from the time that ho endonucleas cleav mat until the detect of mat alpha dna min | when unbud g phase cell | to the opposit mate type in quot | pair | quot | in the presenc of the dna synthesi inhibitor hydroxyurea | ho cleavag but cell to complet switch | in these cell | the ho end of mata stabl for at least h | upon remov of hydroxyurea | the cell the switch in approxim h | the same kinet of mat switch also seen in asynchronou cultur and when synchronousli grow cell at differ time of the cell cycle | thu | the onli restrict that confin normal homothal switch to the g phase of the cell cycle the express of ho endonucleas | further evid that galactos cell can switch in the g phase of the cell cycle the observ that these cell not alwai switch in pair | thi suggest that two chromatid | both cleav with ho endonucleas | can interact independ with the donor hml alpha and hmra |
