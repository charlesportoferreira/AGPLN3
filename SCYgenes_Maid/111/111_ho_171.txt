homothal switch of saccharomyc mate type gene by us donor contain larg intern delet | homothal switch of the mate type gene of saccharomyc occur by gene convers event | replac sequenc at the mat with dna segment from on of two unexpress loci | hml or hmr | the transpos ya or y alpha sequenc ar flank by region that ar to be essenti for switch | we the transposit of mate type gene | hmr alpha delta | which contain base pair delet span the site where the ho endonucleas gener doubl strand break in mat that initi the gene convers event | despit the fact that the end of the mat region no longer share homolog with the donor hmr alpha delta | switch of mata or mat alpha to mat alpha delta effici | howev | there mark increas in the number of aberr event | especi the format of haploid inviabl fusion between mat and the hmr alpha delta donor |
