site specif recombin by i scei | mitochondri group i intron endonucleas in the yeast nucleu | the saccharomyc mitochondri endonucleas i scei creat doubl strand break as the initi step in the gene conversion transfer of the omega | intron to omega dna | we have galactos induc synthetic i scei gene in the nucleu of yeast that also carri the i scei recognit site on substrat | we find that the galactos i scei protein can be activ in the nucleu and effici catalyz recombin | with target contain direct repeat of the escherichia coli lacz gene | on copi of which is interrupt by bp cut site | galactos induct produc both delet and gene convers | both the kinet and the proport of delet and gene convers ar veri similar to analog event initi by galactos induc ho endonucleas gene | we also find that | in mutant strain | the repair of doubl strand break initi by i scei and by ho ar similarli | the format of delet is | but not | altogeth | these result suggest either that the two endonucleas act in the same wai after doubl strand break format or that the two endonucleas ar not in subsequ step |
