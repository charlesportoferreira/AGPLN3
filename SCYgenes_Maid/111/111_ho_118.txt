mutat and function analysi of domin spt | sin | suppressor allel in saccharomyc | the saccharomyc spt gene by genet screen for which ar suppressor of ty and delta insert at the hi | the abil of spt to the transcript interfer by the delta promot insert hi delta correl with an increas in wild type hi mrna level | the spt gene is ident to sin | which code for factor genet as neg regul of ho transcript | in spt | sin the effect of tran act in gene and of partial delet in the termin domain of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii | nuclear local and protein sequenc similar that the spt | sin protein mai be to the nonhiston chromosom protein hmg | to assess the signific of thi structur similar and identifi domain of spt function import in the regul of hi delta | we have recess and domin spt by in vitro mutagenesi | we show here that sever allel carri termin delet as well as point in the termin domain of the spt protein exhibit domin suppressor phenotyp | termin basic residu necessari for wild type spt protein function which ar absent from hmg have been | the compet of these mutant spt protein to interfer with the mainten of the hi | spt | phenotyp of hi delta spt | strain is by delet of intern hmg like sequenc and is sensit to the wild type spt | gene dosag | us cross react antipeptid polyclonal antibodi | we demonstr that the intracellular level of the wild type spt protein is not in presenc of domin and furthermor that the revers of the domin by intern delet of hmg like sequenc is not mediat by product or stabil of the mutant polypeptide | our result suggest that the product of domin allel directli compet with the wild type protein | on the basi of primari sequenc similar | we propos that an hmg box like motif is for spt function in vivo and that thi motif also is necessari for the domin suppressor phenotyp by some mutant spt allel |
