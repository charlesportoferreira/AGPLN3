meiotic recombin initi by doubl strand break in delta yeast cell otherwis unabl to initi meiotic recombin | meiotic recombin in saccharomyc is initi by doubl strand break | dsb | we have system to compar the properti of meiotic dsb with those by the site specif ho endonucleas | ho endonucleas under the control of the meiotic specif spo promot | creat dsb at singl site on on of yeast | chromosom | in | strain the time of appear of the ho dsb and of subsequ recombin ar coincid with those by normal meiotic dsb | physical monitor of dna that spo | ho gene convers both in | and in delta cell that cannot initi normal meiotic dsb | we find that the gene is import | but not essenti | for recombin even after dsb ha been in meiotic cell | in delta cell | some dsb ar not repair until broken chromosom ha been packag into spore and is subsequ germin | thi suggest that broken chromosom doe not signal an arrest of progress through meiosi | the recombin defect in delta diploid is not | howev | meiotic specif | as mitot diploid | experienc an ho dsb | exhibit similar departur from wild type recombin |
