suitabl of replac marker for function analysi studi in saccharomyc | the complet yeast sequenc contain larg proport of gene whose biolog function is complet unknown | on approach to elucid the function of these novel gene is by quantit method that exploit the concept of metabol control analysi | an import first step in such an analysi is to determin the effect of delet individu gene on the growth rate | or fit | of saccharomyc | sinc the specif growth rate effect of most gene ar like to be small | thei ar most readili by competit against standard strain in chemostat cultur where the true steadi state demand by metabol control analysi mai be achiev | we have two differ standard strain in which the ho gene is by either hi or kanmx | we demonstr that ho is select neutral site for gene replac | howev | there is signific marker effect associ with hi which | moreov | is depend on the physiological condit for the competit experi | in contrast | the kanmx marker onli small effect on specif growth rate | lt | or | these data suggest that nutrit marker should not be to gener delet mutant for the quantit analysi of gene function in yeast but that kanmx mai be | with confid | for such studi |
