lack of chromosom territori in yeast | promiscu rejoin of broken chromosom end | variou studi suggest that eukaryto chromosom mai occupi distinct territori within the nucleu and that chromosom ar to nuclear matrix | these constraint might limit interchromosom interact | we have molecular genet test to investig whether the chromosom of saccharomyc exhibit such territori | chromosom doubl strand break | dsb | can be effici repair by recombin between flank sequenc | we have strain in which dsb ar deliv simultan to both chromosom iii and chromosom v by induct of the ho endonucleas | the arrang of partial hi and sequenc around each ho recognit site allow the repair of the two dsb in two altern wai | i | the creation of two intrachromosom delet or | ii | the format of pair of reciproc transloc | we show that reciproc transloc ar approxim as often as the pair of intrachromosom delet | similar result when on of the target region move from chromosom v to ani of three differ locat on chromosom xi | these result argu that the broken end of mitot chromosom ar free to search the entir genom for appropri partner | thu | mitot chromosom ar not function confin to domain of the nucleu | at least when chromosom ar broken |
