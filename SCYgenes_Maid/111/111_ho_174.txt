site specif endonucleas essenti for mate type switch in saccharomyc | we have two site specif endonucleas in strain of saccharomyc | on endonucleas | which we call yz endo | is present onli in yeast strain that ar undergo mate type interconvers | the site at which yz endo cleav correspond to the in vivo doubl strand break occur at the mate type in yeast undergo mate type interconvers | yz endo gener site specif doubl strand break have base | extens termin in | hydroxyl group | the site of cleavag occur in the z region near the yz junction of the mate type | mutant mate type loci known to decreas the frequenc of mate type interconvers ar correspondingli poor substrat for yz endo in vitro | in vitro analysi of number of such recognit site ha delimit the sequenc for cleavag | the molecular genet of mate type interconvers is discuss in the context of thi endonucleolyt activ | the second endonucleas | which we refer to as sce ii | is present in all strain of | we have | the cleavag site of sce ii ha been and prove to be unrel to the cleavag site of yz endo |
