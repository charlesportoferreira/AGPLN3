the tran action of hmra in mate type interconvers | hml and hmr ar the site of cryptic mate type gene in the yeast saccharomyc | in the presenc of the ho gene | the inform from hml or hmr | an or alpha cassett | is transfer to the mate type | mat | hml | hmr | and mat ar on chromosom iii | yet ar wide separ | similarli | in other yeast | at least some of the gene in mate type interconvers ar to the mate type | we demonstr here that cassett donor | hmr | and the cassett target | mat | need not be physicalli for success mate type interconvers | in particular | we show that hmra on on chromosom can donat an cassett to the mate type on chromosom iii |
