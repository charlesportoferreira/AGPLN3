an abfp termin region lack transcript activ potenti stimul yeast origin of replic | although it ha been that eukaryot cellular origin of dna replic mai harbor stimulatori element that bind transcript factor | how these factor stimul origin function is unknown | in saccharomyc | the transcript factor abfp stimul origin function of ar and ar | in the result here | an analysi of abfp function ha been out util lexa | bd | abfp fusion protein and an ar deriv harbor lexa dna bind site | minim region which stimul origin function to amino acid within the terminu of abfp | when for transcript activ of lacz report gene | the same lexa | bd | abfp fusion protein neglig transcript activ potenti | therefor | stimul of ar mai occur independ of transcript activ domain | it ha been previous that the galp | rapp dna bind site and the lexa galp fusion protein can replac the role of abfp in stimul ar | here we show that the stimulatori function of abfp at ar cannot be by these altern dna bind site and the potent chimer transcript activ lexa | bd | gal | ad | henc | these result strongli suggest that the abfp stimul of replic mai differ for ar and ar | and impli specif in the abfp | ar relationship |
