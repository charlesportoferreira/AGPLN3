in vivo analysi of function region within yeast rapp | we have the in vivo import of differ region of rapp | yeast transcript regul and bind protein | yeast strain | scr | contain regulat gene to test function complement by rang of rapp deriv | these experi that the terminu of the protein | contain the put transcript activ domain and the region in silenc and function | is not absolut essenti for cell growth | result by sporul of diploid strain contain termin delet deriv of | northern analysi with cell that rapp lack the transcript activ domain that thi region is import for the express of onli subset of rapp gene | the on essenti region within rapp is the dna bind domain | we have the possibl that thi region ha addit function | it contain two myb like subdomain separ by linker region | individu point in the linker region no effect on rapp function | although delet of the region cell growth | the second myb like subdomain contain larg unstructur loop of unknown function | domain swap experi with combin of element from dna bind domain of rapp homologu from differ yeast that major chang can be to the amino acid composit of thi region without affect rapp function |
