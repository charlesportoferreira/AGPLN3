telomer protein distribut and remodel through the cell cycle in saccharomyc | in saccharomyc | telomer dna is by nonnucleosom protein complex | by the protein | rif and sir protein | which interact with rapp | ar to have further interact with convent nucleosom chromatin to creat repress structur that protect the chromosom end | we by microarrai analysi that rifp associ with the chromosom end extend to subtelomer region mani kilobas intern to the termin telomer repeat and correl strongli with the previous genom of rapp and the sir protein in these region | although the end protect function of telomer is essenti for genom stabil | telomer dna must also be by the convent dna replic machineri and replenish by telomeras | suggest that transient remodel of the telomer chromatin might result in distinct protein complex at differ stage of the cell cycle | us chromatin immunoprecipit | we the associ of rapp | rifp | rifp | and the protein compon of telomeras | estp | with telomer dna through the cell cycle | we provid evid for dynamic remodel of these compon at telomer |
