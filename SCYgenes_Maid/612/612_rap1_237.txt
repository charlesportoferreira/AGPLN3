purif and clone of dna bind protein from yeast that bind to both silenc and activ element | dna bind protein | previous sbf e | ha been shown to bind to put regulatori site at both yeast mate type silenc | yet is not the product of genet regul of the silent loci | here | we report the purif of by dna affin chromatographi | and the isol of it gene from genom librari us antibodi against the protein | disrupt of the chromosom copi of thi gene is lethal | we show that protein also bind in vitro to the upstream activ site | ua | of mat alpha and ribosom protein gene | in addit | we show that two differ ua associ bind site can substitut in vivo for silenc bind site | our result suggest that mai be transcript regul that can plai role in either repress or activ of transcript | depend upon the context of it bind site |
