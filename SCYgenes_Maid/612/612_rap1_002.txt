the number of vertebr repeat can be at yeast telomer by independ mechan | the number of telomer dna repeat at chromosom end is around mean valu by dynamic balanc between elong and shorten | in particular | protein bind along the duplex part of telomer dna the number of repeat by progress limit growth | the paradigm of thi count mechan is the protein in saccharomyc | we demonstr here that independ mechan regul the number of yeast telomer repeat | tg | and of vertebr repeat | t | ag | when tel | yeast ortholog of the human gene encod the atm kinas | is | in addit | we show that t | ag | onli can be and in human yeast cell carri templat mutat of the gene encod the telomeras rna | which lead to the synthesi of vertebr instead of yeast repeat | genet and biochem evid indic that thi is in independ manner | both in tel and in teldelta human yeast cell | altogeth | these find light on multipl repeat count mechan | which mai share critic featur between lower and higher eukaryot |
