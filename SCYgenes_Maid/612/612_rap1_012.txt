rapp and other transcript regul can function in defin distinct domain of gene express | barrier element that ar abl to block the propag of transcript silenc in yeast ar function similar to chromatin boundari | insul element in metazoan that delimit function chromosom domain | we show that the upstream activ sequenc of mani highli ribosom protein gene and glycolytic gene exhibit barrier activ | analys of these barrier indic that bind site for transcript regul rapp | abfp | rebp | adrp and gcnp mai particip in barrier function | we also present evid suggest that rapp is directli in barrier activ | and it barrier function correl with local chang in chromatin structur | we further demonstr that tether the transcript activ domain of rapp to dna is suffici to recapitul barrier activ | moreov | target the activ domain of adrp or gcnp also establish barrier to silenc | these result support the notion that transcript regul could also particip in delimit function domain in the genom |
