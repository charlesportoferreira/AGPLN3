trf is dimer and bend telomer dna | trf is mammalian telomer protein that bind to the duplex arrai of ttaggg repeat at chromosom end | trf ha homolog to the dna bind domain of the myb famili of transcript factor but | unlik most myb protein | trf carri on rather than multipl myb type dna bind motif | here we show that trf bind dna as dimer us larg domain near the n terminu of the protein for trf trf interact | dimer both in complex with dna and in the yeast two hybrid assai | trf dimer to requir both myb repeat for the format of stabl complex with dna | indic parallel between the dna bind mode of trf and other myb protein | trf to have number of biochem similar to rapp | distantli dna bind protein that function at telomer in yeast | rapp and trf both requir two myb motif for dna bind and both factor bind along their cognat telomer sequenc without show strong cooper interact between adjac protein | furthermor | trf to bend it telomer site to an angl of degre | sinc rapp similarli distort telomer dna | we propos that dna bend is import for the function of telomer in yeast and mammal |
