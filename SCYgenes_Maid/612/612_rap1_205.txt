function analysi of the promot of the gene encod the acid ribosom protein l in yeast | the gene encod the acid ribosom protein l in yeast is coordin with other rp gene | the promot region of thi gene harbour bind site for cp and abf | we demonstr that the cp site is not in the transcript activ of the l gene | rather | the abf site | through deviat from the consensu sequenc | rtarynacg | appear to be essenti for effici transcript | replac of thi site by consensu bind site | an rpg box | not alter the transcript yield of the l gene | an addit transcript activ region is present downstream of the abf site | the relev nucleotid sequenc | which is in the l gene promot | give rise to complex format with yeast protein extract in bandshift assai | the result indic that the l gene promot ha complex architectur |
