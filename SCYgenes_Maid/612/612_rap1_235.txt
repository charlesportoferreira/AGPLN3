connect between transcript activ | silenc | and telomer as by function analysi of yeast dna bind protein | gener regulatori factor i | grfi | is yeast protein that bind in vitro to specif dna sequenc at divers genet element | strategi pursu to test whether grfi function in vivo at the sequenc by the factor in vitro | match to consensu sequenc for grfi bind in varieti of locat | upstream activ sequenc | uass | silenc | telomer | and transcrib region | all occurr of the consensu sequenc both crude and grfi in vitro | all bind site for grfi | regardless of origin | ua function in test plasmid | also | grfi bind site specif transcript in yeast in vitro system | indic that grfi can function as posit transcript factor | the stimulatori effect of grfi bind site at uass for the pyk and eno gene is significantli by flank dna element | by contrast | regulatori sequenc that the grfi bind site at hmr e convert thi region to transcript silenc |
