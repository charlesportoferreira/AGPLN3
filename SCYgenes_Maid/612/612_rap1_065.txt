maxim stimul of meiotic recombin by yeast transcript factor requir the transcript activ domain and dna bind domain | the dna sequenc upstream of the yeast hi repres veri strong meiotic recombin hotspot | although the activ of thi hotspot requir the transcript activ rapp | the level of hi transcript is not directli to the level of recombin | we find that the recombin stimul activ of rapp requir the transcript activ domain of the protein | we show that hybrid protein with the galp dna bind domain and the rapp activ domain can stimul recombin in strain in which galp bind site ar upstream of hi | in addit | we find recombin hotspot activ associ with the galp dna bind site that is independ of known transcript factor | we suggest that yeast cell have two type of recombin hotspot | alpha | transcript factor depend | and beta | transcript factor independ |
