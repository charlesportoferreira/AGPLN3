format of boundari of transcription silent chromatin by nucleosom exclud structur | the eukaryot genom is divid into chromosom domain of distinct gene activ | transcription silent chromatin tend to encroach upon activ chromatin | barrier element that can block the spread of silent chromatin have been document | but the mechan of their function ar not | we show that the prokaryot lexa protein can function as barrier to the propag of transcription silent chromatin in yeast | the barrier function of lexa correl with it abil to disrupt local chromatin structur | in accord with thi | ccgnn | n | and poli | da dt | both of which do not favor nucleosom format | can also act as effici boundari of silent chromatin | moreov | we show that rapp bind barrier element also chromatin structur | these result demonstr that nucleosom exclus is on of the mechan for the establish of boundari of silent chromatin domain |
