how the multifunct yeast rapp discrimin between dna target site | crystallographic analysi | rapp from saccharomyc is multifunct | sequenc specif | dna bind protein in divers cellular process such as transcript activ and silenc | and is an essenti factor for length regul and mainten | in order to understand how rapp discrimin between it differ dna bind site | we have the crystal structur of the dna bind domain of the rapp | rappdbd | in complex with two differ dna bind site | the first dna sequenc is the hmre bind site at silenc | which contain four base pair substitut in comparison to the telomer bind site present in our earlier crystal structur of the rappdbd teloa complex | the second complex contain an altern telomer bind site | telo | in which two half site ar space closer togeth than in the teloa complex | the determin of these structur complic by the presenc of merohedr twin in the crystal | through identif of the twin oper and determin of the twin fraction of the crystal | we abl to deconvolut the twin intens into their untwin compon | and to calcul electron densiti map for both complex | the structur inform show that the two domain present in the rappdbd bind to these two biolog relev bind site through subtl side chain movement at the protein dna interfac | rather than through global domain rearrang | copyright academ press |
