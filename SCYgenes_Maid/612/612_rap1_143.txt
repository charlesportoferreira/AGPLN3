histon h and h n termini interact with sir and sir protein | molecular model for the format of heterochromatin in yeast | the silent mate loci and chromosom region adjac to telomer of | have featur similar to heterochromatin of more complex eukaryot | transcript repress at these site depend on the silent inform regul sir and sir as well as histon h and h | we show here that the sir and sir protein interact with specif silenc domain of the h and h n termini in vitro | certain in these factor | which affect their silenc function in vivo | also disrupt their interact in vitro | immunofluoresc studi with antibodi against and sir demonstr that the h and h n termini ar for the associ of sir with telomer chromatin and the perinuclear posit of yeast telomer | base on these interact | we propos model for heterochromatin mediat transcript silenc in yeast | which mai serv as paradigm for other eukaryot organ as well |
