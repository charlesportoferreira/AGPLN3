characteris of the dna bind domain of the yeast protein | the amino acid yeast protein interact with dna to regul gene express at numer unrel loci in the yeast genom | by combin of amino | carboxi and intern delet | we have an intern amino acid fragment of the yeast protein that can bind effici to the bind site of the pgk upstream activ sequenc | ua | thi domain span residu to of the full length protein and lack ani homolog to the dna bind | zinc finger | or | helix turn helix | structur motif | all the bind site we have bind domain | argu that bind all it chromosom site via thi domain | the domain could not be further in size suggest that it repres the minim function dna bind domain | the relev of potenti region of secondari structur within the minim bind domain is discuss |
