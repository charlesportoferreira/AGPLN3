multimer of hspp | novel heat shock protein of saccharomyc | is depend on carboxyl termin sequenc | rapp is transcript regul of saccharomyc | which plai role in both transcript activ and silenc | to identifi protein in rapp depend regul of transcript | we the two hybrid system to screen for rapp interact protein | two of the clone from thi screen protein with homolog to small heat shock protein | hsp | here we present an analysi of thi novel | hsp | which we name hspp | express of hsp is by rang of stress condit similar to | hsp | with which hspp share most homolog | howev | hsp express is more sensit to salt concentr and to starvat and | in contrast to hsp is in unstress cell | hspp interact with itself in the two hybrid assai | thi interact is depend on hydrophobic region which is among small hsp | us bacteri hspp fusion protein | we demonstr that thi is direct interact | fraction of yeast protein extract by size demonstr that all of the hspp in these extract is present in complex with molecular mass of greater than kda | suggest that hspp exist in high molecular mass complex |
