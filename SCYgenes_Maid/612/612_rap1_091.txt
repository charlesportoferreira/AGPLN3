protein count mechan for length regul in yeast | in the yeast saccharomyc | elong is neg by the repeat bind protein rapp | such that narrow length distribut of repeat tract is | thi length regul shown to function independ of the orient of the repeat | the number of repeat at an individu when hybrid protein contain the rapp carboxyl terminu target there by heterolog dna bind domain | the extent of thi tract shorten proport to the number of target molecul | consist with feedback mechan of length regul that can discrimin the precis number of rapp molecul to the chromosom end |
