prolin biosynthesi in saccharomyc | molecular analysi of the pro gene | which encod gamma glutamyl kinas | the pro gene of saccharomyc encod the amino acid protein gamma glutamyl kinas | atp | l glutam phosphotransferas | ec | which catalyz the first step in prolin biosynthesi | amino acid sequenc comparison signific homolog between the yeast and escherichia coli gamma glutamyl kinas throughout their length | four close match to the consensu sequenc for gcn protein bind and on close match to the protein bind site in the pro upstream region | the respons of the pro gene to chang in the growth medium by measur of steadi state mrna level and of beta galactosidas activ by pro lacz gene fusion | pro express not by exogen prolin and not by the presenc of glutam in the growth medium | although express of the pro gene not chang in respons to histidin starvat | both steadi state pro mrna level and beta galactosidas activ in gcd strain and in gcn strain | in addit | pro bradytrophic strain complet auxotroph for prolin in gcn strain background | these result indic that pro is by the gener amino acid control system |
