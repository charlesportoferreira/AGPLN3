the crystal structur of the dna bind domain of yeast in complex with telomer dna | telomer | the nucleoprotein complex at the end of eukaryot chromosom | ar essenti for chromosom stabil | in the yeast | telomer dna is in sequenc specif manner by | multifunct protein also in transcript regul | here we report the crystal structur of the dna bind domain of in complex with telomer dna site at | resolut | the protein contain two similar domain that bind dna in tandem orient | recogn tandemli dna sequenc | the domain ar structur to the homeodomain and the proto oncogen myb | but show novel featur in their dna bind mode | structur linker between the domain and long termin tail contribut to the bind specif | thi structur provid insight into the recognit of the telomer dna sequenc by protein |
