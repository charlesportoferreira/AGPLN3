transcript of gene encod tran act factor for rrna matur | ribosom subunit assembl is coordin with ribosom protein gene and involv in saccharomyc | we demonstr that the gene encod tran act factor essenti for pre rrna process | ribosom subunit assembl ar respons to variou kind of stress such as heat shock | nitrogen depriv and secretori defect | in coordin with ribosom protein gene in saccharomyc | the mutat | which produc the termin protein of transcript factor rapp | affect transcript repress of the tran act factor gene due to secretori defect as shown previous for both ribosom protein and rrna gene |
