coordin regul of yeast ribosom protein gene is associ with target recruit of esa histon acetylas | the esa contain nua histon acetylas complex can interact with activ domain in vitro and stimul transcript on chromatin templat | in yeast cell | esa is target to small subset of promot in an activ specif manner | esa is specif to ribosom protein | rp | promot | and thi recruit appear to requir bind by or abf | esa is import for rp transcript | and esa recruit to rp promot correl with coordin regul of rp gene in respons to growth stimuli | howev | follow esa deplet | h acetyl decreas dramat at mani loci | but transcript is not gener | therefor | the transcript associ target recruit of esa to rp promot occur in background of more global acetyl that is itself not for transcript |
