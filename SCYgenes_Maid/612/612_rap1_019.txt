sir bind independ of other sir | yku | or histon interact initi the assembl of telomer heterochromatin in yeast | in saccharomyc | heterochromatin like region ar near telomer and at the silent mate type loci | where thei can repress gene in an epigenet manner | sever protein ar in telomer heterochromatin structur includ | sir | sir | sir | yku | hdf | yku | hdf | and the n termini of histon h and h | by recogn ci act dna bind site | is to recruit sir and other silenc protein and determin where heterochromatin form | the integr of heterochromatin also requir the bind of sir protein to histon that mai form scaffold for sir protein interact with chromatin | in thi studi we describ how the heterochromatin complex mai form initi and how it differ from the complex that spread along the chromosom | we that close to the end | sir can bind independ of sir | sir | yku | yku | and the intact h n terminu | in contrast | sir bind requir all of the silenc factor further along telomer heterochromatin | these data indic that sir bind to initi the sequenti associ of sir and other protein | allow the subsequ spread of the heterochromatin protein along the chromosom |
