factor is necessari for dna loop format in vitro at the silent mate type hml | dna fragment contain the silenc that the mate type gene at hml alpha ar shown to bind specif to the nuclear scaffold of yeast | the scaffold protein ar solubil with urea and then to form solubl extract which allow reconstitut of sequenc specif dna loop | at the silent mate type hml alpha | loop ar by either silenc silenc | e i | interact or silenc promot interact | e and i | the nuclear protein fraction effici with the nuclear scaffold | and bind to the e | i | and promot region | affin purif of and oligonucleotid competit show that is necessari for reconstitut of loop in vitro | these result ar consist with model in which silenc defin chromatin loop within which occur modif that maintain the promot in an inact state |
