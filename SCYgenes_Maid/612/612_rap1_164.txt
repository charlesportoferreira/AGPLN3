differenti transcript of the two saccharomyc gene encod elong factor | the singl polypeptide chain of elong factor | ef | is by two saccharomyc gene | eft and eft | with uniqu flank sequenc | on gene is necessari and either is suffici for cell viabil | in the present work | we have the transcript of eft and eft | although both gene harbor multipl transcript start point | eft initi primarili at at and eft at at | sever candid tata box in each gene | delet analysi emploi lacz promot fusion that the promot for eft is within bp region begin nucleotid | nt | upstream from the start atg codon | thi region contain two overlap sequenc with homolog to the consensu bind site for the yeast transcript factor | rapp | grfp | tuf | in contrast | the sequenc essenti for the transcript of eft to the region between the start atg and the stop codon of the vp gene that termin nt upstream on the same strand | analysi of promot strength us lacz fusion that the promot for eft is approx | fold more activ than that of eft | analysi of the steadi state level of mrna that eft contribut approx | of the total ef mrna while the remain | is by eft | we conclud that the differ in express of eft and eft is due to the differenti transcript of their promot |
