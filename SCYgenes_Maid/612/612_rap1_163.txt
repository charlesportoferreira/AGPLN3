the yeast bind protein bind to and promot the format of dna quadruplex in telomer dna | the protein is essenti for the mainten of the telomer of saccharomyc and bind in vitro to multipl site within the tg telomer repeat | we show here that | in addit to it known bind activ for doubl strand dna | bind sequenc specif to the strand | thi indic that is the protein that bind to the telomer termin tail | furthermor | we have that bind to and promot the format of g tetrad | i | e | dna quadruplex | in strand oligonucleotid at nanomolar concentr | the format of dna quadruplex appear to involv the intermolecular associ of strand | the minim dna bind domain of | dbd | bind onli to doubl strand dna | so that the novel dna bind activ we have involv region of the protein outsid of the dbd | the find that telomer protein promot the format of g tetrad argu for the us of dna quadruplex in associ |
