reloc of telomer ku and sir protein in respons to dna strand break in yeast | telomer tg rich repeat and their associ protein protect the termini of eukaryot chromosom from end to end fusion | associ with the cap structur at yeast telomer is subtelomer domain of heterochromatin | contain the silent inform regul | sir | complex | the ku | heterodim | yku | is associ both with the chromosom end and with subtelomer chromatin | surprisingli | both yku and the chromatin associ and sir protein ar releas from telomer in depend respons to dna damag | yku is rapidli to doubl strand cut | while low level of sir protein ar near cleavag site at later time point | consist | yku or sir defici strain ar to dna damag agent | the releas of yku from telomer chromatin mai allow effici scan of the genom for dna strand break |
