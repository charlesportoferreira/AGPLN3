dna bind protein stimul meiotic recombin at the hi in yeast | in the yeast saccharomyc | as in other eukaryot | some region of the genom have much higher rate of meiotic recombin than other | we show below that the bind of the protein to site upstream of the hi gene is necessari for high rate of meiotic | but not mitot | recombin at thi | mutat in the bind site at hi result in decreas in recombin | overproduct of caus an increas in recombin at hi abov wild type level |
