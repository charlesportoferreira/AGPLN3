spread of transcript repressor sir from telomer heterochromatin | telomer gene and the hm loci in saccharomyc ar transcription and adopt heterochromatin like structur | the tran act factor | sir and sir ar for telomer and hm silenc | and ar to be chromosom | but how thei contribut to histon depend repress of adjac chromatin is unclear | sir suppress silenc defect in histon | is limit for silenc adjac to telomer | and interact with the h and h amino termini in vitro | here we show that sir co immunoprecipit sir | and histon from cellular extract | suggest the presenc of larg chromatin associ protein complex | crosslink experi show that sir is present at hmra | hmlalpha and telomer in vivo | and that is spread from telomer region into adjac chromatin when | thu sir is structur compon of yeast heterochromatin | repress adjac gene as it spread along the chromosom |
