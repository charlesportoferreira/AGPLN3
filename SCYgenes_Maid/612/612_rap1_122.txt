highli toxic of saccharomyc rapp | bud yeast | saccharomyc | rapp ha been in fission yeast | schizosaccharomyc | under the control of the regulat fructos bisphosphatas | fbp | promot | when the fbp promot | cell contain the complet gene to show ani signific growth | suggest that rapp is toxic | deriv of rapp that ha temperatur sensit mutat in the dna bind domain not toxic in cell grown at degre | temperatur at which dna bind by rapp | ts | is sever | remov of short region downstream of the dna bind domain | includ region previous shown to be essenti for rapp toxic in bud yeast | also the toxic effect | the toxic effect of rapp ha therefor been between two distantli yeast | in bud yeast | overexpress of rapp also chang to the length of the telomer repeat | no effect on telomer in fission yeast |
