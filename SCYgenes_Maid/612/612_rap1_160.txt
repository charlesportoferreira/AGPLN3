evid that complex of sir protein interact with the silenc and bind protein | the mainten of transcript silenc at hm mate type loci and telomer in yeast requir the sir | sir | and sir protein | none of which appear to be dna bind protein | here we show that sir and sir interact with carboxi termin domain of the silenc | and ua bind protein | we sir and sir in two hybrid screen for interact factor and that sir interact both with itself and with sir | the interact between and sir can be in vitro in the absenc of other yeast protein | consist with the notion that nativ sir protein interact with the carboxyl terminu | we show that mutat of the endogen sir and sir gene increas transcript activ by lexa | hybrid | to test the import of the sir interact for silenc | we in the carboxyl terminu that either diminish or abolish thi interact | when into the nativ protein | these caus correspond defect in silenc at both hmr and telomer | we propos that act in the initi of transcript silenc by recruit complex of sir protein to the chromosom via protein protein interact | these data ar consist with model in which sir and sir plai structur role in the mainten of silent chromatin and indic that their action is initi at the silenc itself |
