superfamili of domain in dna damag respons cell cycle checkpoint protein | comput analysi of domain | brct | first at the carboxyl terminu of the breast cancer protein brca | bind protein | bp | and the yeast cell cycle checkpoint protein larg superfamili of domain that occur predominantli in protein in cell cycle checkpoint function respons to dna damag | the brct domain consist of approxim amino acid residu and occur as tandem repeat at the carboxyl terminu of numer protein | but ha been also as tandem repeat at the amino terminu or as singl copi | the brct superfamili present includ approxim nonortholog protein | name | brca | bp | and | protein famili that consist of the fission yeast replic checkpoint protein | the oncoprotein ect | the dna repair protein xrcc | and yeast dna polymerase subunit dpb | dna bind enzyme such as termin deoxynucleotidyltransferase | deoxycytidyl transferas in dna repair | and dna ligas iii and iv | yeast multifunct transcript factor | and sever uncharacter gene product | anoth previous domain that is by bacteri nad depend dna ligas | the larg subunit of eukaryot replic factor | and poli | adp ribos | polymerase appear to be distinct version of the brct domain | the retinoblastoma protein | univers tumor suppressor | and protein mai contain distant rel of the brct domain | despit the function divers of all these protein | particip in dna damag respons checkpoint appear to be unifi theme | thu | the brct domain is like to perform critic | yet uncharacter | function in the cell cycle control of organ from bacteria to human | the carboxytermin brct domain of brca correspond precis to the recent minim transcript activ domain of thi protein | indic on such function |
