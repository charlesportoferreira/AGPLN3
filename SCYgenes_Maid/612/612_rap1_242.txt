genom wide local of the nuclear transport machineri coupl transcript statu and nuclear organ | the associ of gene with the nuclear pore complex | npc | and nuclear transport factor ha been implic in transcript regul | we therefor the associ of compon of the nuclear transport machineri includ karyopherin | nucleoporin | and the ran guanin nucleotid exchang factor | rangef | with the saccharomyc genom | we find that most nucleoporin and karyopherin preferenti associ with subset of highli transcrib gene and with gene that possess bind site wherea the rangef preferenti associ with transcription inact gene | consist with coupl of transcript to the nuclear pore | we show that transcript activ of the gal gene result in their associ with nuclear pore protein | reloc to the nuclear peripheri | and loss of rangef associ | taken togeth | these result indic that the organ of the genom is coupl via transcript state to the nuclear transport machineri |
