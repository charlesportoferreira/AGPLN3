transcript control of the saccharomyc pgk gene by | the promot of the yeast glycolytic gene encod phosphoglycer kinas | pgk | contain an upstream activ sequenc between base and upstream of the initi atg | the upstream activ sequenc contain multipl function element | includ an essenti region the activ core | ac | sequenc and three copi of the pentam | cttcc | the ac sequenc show strong homolog to the consensu bind site for the yeast protein | grf | and tuf | we have that the yeast protein which interact with the ac sequenc is the dna bind protein | express of the pgk gene is to be accord to the carbon sourc in the growth medium | pgk mrna level ar high in yeast cell grown in glucos medium but low in yeast cell grown in media contain carbon sourc such as pyruvate and acet | thi carbon sourc regul of transcript to be mediat | in part | via regul of bind to the ac sequenc | the promot of mani other yeast glycolytic gene also contain consensu bind site and copi of the cttcc pentam | thi suggest that mai be in transcript control of mani other glycolytic gene in addit to the pgk gene |
