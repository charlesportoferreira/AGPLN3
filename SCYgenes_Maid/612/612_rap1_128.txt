class of singl strand telomer dna bind protein for rapp local in yeast nuclei | we have class of protein that bind singl strand telomer dna and ar for the nuclear organ of telomer and | or associ protein | rlfp by it sequenc similar to gbpp | singl strand telomer dna bind protein from chlamydomona reinhardtii | rlfp and gbpp bind yeast singl strand g strand telomer dna | both protein includ at least two rna recognit motif | which ar in mani protein that interact with singl strand nucleic acid | disrupt of rlf alter the distribut of repressor | activ protein | rapp | associ protein | in wild type yeast cell | rapp local to small number of perinuclear spot | while in rlf cell rapp appear diffus and nuclear | interestingli | posit effect and length control | which requir | ar unaffect by rlf | demonstr that rapp local can be uncoupl from other rapp depend function | in addit | express of chlamydomona gbp restor perinuclear | punctat rapp local in rlf mutant cell | the function complement of fungal gene by an algal gene suggest that rlfp and gbpp ar member of class of singl strand telomer dna bind protein that influenc nuclear organ | furthermor | it demonstr that | despit their unusu codon bia | reinhardtii gene can be effici translat in saccharomyc cell |
