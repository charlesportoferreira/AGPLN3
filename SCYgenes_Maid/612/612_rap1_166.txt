in vitro identif of protein of saccharomyc that interact specif with the g rich dna strand of the | the telomer of saccharomyc consist of g t | dna sequenc that form complex with protein | to date onli the protein ha been shown to bind to the simpl sequenc in yeast telomer dna | as well as to non telomer regulatori site | we have synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotid | both doubl and singl strand | to identifi specif yeast telomer protein in partial yeast extract | us the gel shift assai | we bind activ that is stabl at high ionic strength and that recogn specif the g rich protrus of doubl strand synthetic yeast | as well as the g rich singl strand | thi is the first evid of pure telomer protein in that it bind to the singl strand telomer protrus of the yeast chromosom |
