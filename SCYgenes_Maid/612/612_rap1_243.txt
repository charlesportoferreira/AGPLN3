dna bind and length regul of yeast homologu | the repressor activ protein | ha mani import function in saccharomyc | at the chromosom end | it is neg regul of length | here | we show that saccharomyc | saccharomyc dairensi telomer sequenc into | ar count as part of the | consist with the presenc of high affin rapp bind site within these sequenc | we show that | rapp | scasrapp | can regul length in | strain | albeit less stringent | clone of the | dairensi homologu | sdairap | that it encod the largest protein to date | despit it larg size | bind analys of the recombin sdairapp that the protein bind with the same space and with similar affin to yeast telomer sequenc | as the scer and scasrap protein | accord to the rapp count model for length regul | low densiti of rapp bind site in would result in longer in | we have the length of two individu | dairensi telomer and find that their length ar not to give the same number of high affin bind site | thi mai be due to other factor than rapp have influenc on the length regul |
