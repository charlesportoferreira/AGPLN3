yeast ku protein plai direct role in telomer silenc and counteract inhibit by rif protein | ykup | ykup | the yeast ku protein homologu | is dna end bind heterodim in non end join | it also bind to telomer | where it plai an import role in the mainten of telomer dna structur | ku protein | togeth with rapp | telomer dna | tg | repeat | bind protein | is also to initi transcript silenc | or posit effect | tpe | here | we provid evid for direct role of ku in tpe | which is most like to be in either the recruit or activ of sir protein at the | surprisingli | howev | the essenti role of ku in tpe is to overcom the inhibitori effect of two rapp interact protein | rifp and rifp | both of which also plai an import role in length regul | previou studi that rif and sir protein compet for bind to the carboxyl terminu of rapp | in the absenc of thi competit | for exampl | when rif gene ar | ku is no longer necessari for tpe | wherea the rapp carboxyl terminu is still absolut | we show that rifp is to telomer | indic that it inhibitori effect on tpe is direct | our data implic role for ku in the competit between sir and rif protein for access to the telomer arrai of rapp molecul | which result in balanc between telomer silenc and length control |
