global regul of ribosom biosynthesi in yeast | three abund ubiquit dna bind protein factor appear to plai major role in the control of ribosom biosynthesi in yeast | two of these factor mediat the regul of transcript of ribosom protein gene | rp gene | in yeast | most yeast rp gene ar under transcript control of rapp | repressor activ protein | while small subset of rp gene is through abfp | ar bind factor | the third protein | rebp | rrna enhanc bind protein | which bind strongli to two site upstream of the enhanc and the promot of the rrna operon | respect | appear to plai crucial role in the effici transcript of the chromosom rdna | all three protein | howev | have mani target site on the yeast genom | in particular | in the upstream region of sever pol ii transcrib gene | suggest that thei plai much more gener role than sole in the regul of ribosom biosynthesi | furthermor | some evid ha been suggest that these factor influenc the chromatin structur and creat nucleosom free region surround their bind site | recent studi indic that the protein can function replac each other in variou case and that thei act synergisticalli with adjac addit dna sequenc | these data suggest that abfp | rapp | and rebp ar primari dna bind protein that serv to render adjac ci act element access to specif tran act factor |
