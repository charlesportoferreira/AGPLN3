properti of the transcript enhanc in saccharomyc telomer | saccharomyc chromosom end with the sequenc | ca | commonli abbrevi as | these sequenc can function as upstream activ of transcript | ua | when in front of cyc lacz fusion gene | when sequenc ar between the gal | ua and the cyc lacz fusion | the ua still function and the amount of beta galactosidas in cell grown on glucos is as much or more than that for cell grown on either glycerol medium | or cell grown on glucos medium contain with just the ua | these data indic that the ua is immun from glucos repress from the upstream gal | ua | becaus sequenc ar in vitro by the transcript factor | the ua activ of yeast sequenc with that of similar ua from the tightli ribosom protein gene rpa | which also contain bind site | while transcript from the ribosom protein gene ua respons to cell densiti | the amount of transcript from the ua nearli the same at all cell densiti | these data show that the transcript activ by sequenc is not by cell densiti |
