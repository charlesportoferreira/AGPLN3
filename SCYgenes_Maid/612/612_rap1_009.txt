mutant telomer inhibit transcript silenc at nativ telomer of the yeast kluyveromyce | we report the identif and character of transcript silenc at nativ telomer in the bud yeast kluyveromyce | we show that k | telomer ar abl to repress the transcript of gene at the junction between the telomer repeat tract and the subtelomer domain | as in saccharomyc | switch between the and transcript state occur | termin truncat of the bind protein rapp | which lead to alter in length | reduc telomer silenc | in addit | telomer silenc is dramat in telomeras rna mutant in which length control ha been | thi is consist with the possibl that the structur of the entir affect the silenc function by it intern domain |
