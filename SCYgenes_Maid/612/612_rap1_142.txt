transcript activ of yeast ribosom protein gene requir addit element apart from bind site for abfp or rapp | all ribosom protein | rp | gene promot from saccharomyc so far contain either | usual two | bind site for the global gene regul rapp or on bind site for anoth global factor | abfp | previou analysi of the rp and rpl gene promot that apart from the abf bind site | addit ci act element plai part in transcript activ of these gene | we promot reconstruct system base on the beta glucuronidas report gene to examin the role of the abf bind site and other put ci act element in promot transcript | an abf bind site out to be weak activ element | t rich sequenc from the rp proxim promot to be stronger | but full transcript activ onli achiev by combin of these element | both in the natur rpl promot and in the promot | bind site could function replac the abf bind site | characterist rp gene nutrit control of transcript | evok by carbon sourc upshift or by nitrogen re feed to nitrogen cell | could onli be mediat by the combin abf | or | bind site and t rich element and not by the individu element | these result demonstr that abfp and rapp do not activ rp gene in prototyp fashion | but rather mai serv to potenti transcript activ through the t rich element |
