differ function of smg gdp dissoci stimul and mammalian counterpart of yeast cdc | we have previous shown that both smg gdp dissoci stimul | gd | and mammalian cdc | mcdc | stimul the gdp | gtp exchang reaction of ki ra and that smg gd is activ onli on the post translation modifi form of ki ra | wherea mcdc is activ on both the modifi and unmodifi form but is more activ on the modifi form | in the present studi | we more detail kinet properti of smg gd and mcdc by us of the modifi form of ki ra as common substrat | both smg gd and mcdc the dissoci of gdp from ki ra and the stabl binari complex with ki ra | in the presenc of guanosin | o thio | triphosph | gtp gamma | the stabl ternari complex of smg gd gtp gamma ki ra | wherea gtp gamma the dissoci of mcdc from mcdc ki ra complex | yield gtp gamma ki ra | mcdc the dissoci of gdp from both the membran and solubl form of ki ra | wherea smg gd far less activ on the membran form than on the solubl form | moreov | smg gd the gtp gamma form of membran ki ra to the solubl fraction as the stabl ternari complex of smg gd gtp gamma ki ra | wherea mcdc not show thi activ | these result suggest that smg gd and mcdc plai differ role in the regul of ki ra |
