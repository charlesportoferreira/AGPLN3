rapp and length regul in yeast | length in the yeast saccharomyc is under stringent genet control such that narrow length distribut of tg repeat is | previou studi have shown that rapp | which bind to the doubl strand telomer repeat | plai role in regul repeat length | point in the rapp terminu often result in higher averag length and delet of thi region caus extrem elong | we have further the role of rapp in thi process | our result suggest that length is by neg feedback mechan that can sens the number of rapp molecul at the chromosom end | thi length regulatori mechan requir two other protein | rifp and rifp | that interact with each other and with the rapp terminu | although the same termin domain of rapp is also in the initi of posit effect | telomer transcript silenc | thi rapp function appear to be separ from | and inde antagonist to | it role in length regul |
