genet analysi of rapp | sirp interact in telomer and hml silenc in saccharomyc | we have three sir suppressor of the telomer silenc defect by missens within the rapp termin tail domain | aa | each sir suppressor also capabl of suppress allel | which delet the aa termin tail domain | but none of the suppressor telometr silenc to amino acid truncat allel | these data suggest rapp site for sirp associ between the two truncat point | aa | in sir suppressor strain lack the rapp termin tail domain | the presenc of second intragen mutat within the rap domain | aa | silenc fold | these data suggest competit between sirp and factor that interfer with silenc for associ in the rap domain | strain contain both wild type sirp and either of the sir suppressor protein fold increas in telomer silenc over strain carri either sirp suppressor in the absenc of wild type sirp | we propos that thi specif synergism is mediat in part through stabil of rapp | sirp telometr complex by sirp sirp interact |
