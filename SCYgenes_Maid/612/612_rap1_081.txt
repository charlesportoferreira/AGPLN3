the termin silenc domain of rapp is essenti for the repress of ribosom protein gene in respons to defect in the secretori pathwai | we have previous shown that function secretori pathwai is essenti for continu ribosom synthesi in saccharomyc | when temperatur sensit mutant defect in the secretori pathwai is transfer to the non permiss temperatur | transcript of both rrna gene and ribosom protein gene is nearli | in order to defin the ci act element | of ribosom protein gene sensit to defect in the secretori pathwai | we have seri of fusion gene contain the cyh promot region | with variou delet | to lacz | each fusion gene for which transcript is is subject to the repress | rapp is the transcript activ for most ribosom protein gene | as well as have an import role in silenc in the vicin of telomer and at the silent mate type loci | to assess it role in the repress of transcript by the defect in the secretori pathwai | we have | the replac of wild type rapp by rapp at the termin region substanti attenu of the repress | furthermor | we have that the rapp truncat affect the repress of tcm | encod ribosom protein l | which ha no rapp bind site in it upstream regulatori region | these result suggest that the repress of transcript of ribosom protein gene by secretori defect is mediat through rapp | but doe not requir rapp bind site within the ua |
