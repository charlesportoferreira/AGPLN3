function analysi of replic origin from saccharomyc | identif of new replic enhanc | yeast replic origin have modular arrang of essenti dna sequenc contain the ar consensu sequenc | ac | flank by auxiliari dna element which stimul origin function | on of the auxiliari element at sever origin is dna replic enhanc that bind the abfp protein | we have an ar sequenc from saccharomyc base on it abil to bind abfp | here we present detail molecular dissect of thi ar | ar | and we demonstr that it function as genom replic origin on chromosom xv | mutagenesi of the abfp dna bind site that these sequenc not contribut significantli to ar function | instead | new dna element import for replic | ren | ha been | to the t rich strand of the ac | we show that ren function in either orient and at variabl distanc from the ac | defin thi element as dna replic enhanc | most significantli | point within thi element the stabil of plasmid bear ar | suggest that ren bind protein import for replic initi | onli three element at origin ar known to specif bind protein | these includ the ar essenti sequenc and the abfp and rapp dna bind site | we show that the function of ren at the origin cannot be by rapp dna bind site or site that bind the transcript factor galp and can onli be partial for by an abfp recognit sequenc | thi impli that the role of the ren element at the ar origin is specif | and suggest that the frequenc of origin fire in eukaryot cell mai be by origin specif enhanc |
