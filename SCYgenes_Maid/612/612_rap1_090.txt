novel rapp interact factor | rifp | cooper with rifp to regul length in saccharomyc | the saccharomyc protein bind with high affin to site within the poli | tract at telomer | where it plai role in both length regul and the initi of telomer silenc | rapp initi silenc at telomer by interact through it carboxi termin domain with sirp and sirp | both of which ar for repress | thi same domain of rapp also neg regul elong | through an unknown mechan | we have new interact factor | rifp | that plai role in length regul | rifp ha consider function similar with rapp interact factor | rifp | previous | in rif or rif | unlik in the silenc gene sir and sir | result in moder elong and telomer silenc | howev | delet of both rif and rif in the same cell result in dramat increas in length | similar to that seen with carboxi termin truncat of rapp | in addit | overexpress of either rif or rif decreas length | and co overexpress of these protein can revers the elong effect of overexpress of the rapp carboxyl terminu | final | we show that rifp and rifp can interact with each other in vivo | these result suggest that length regul is mediat by protein complex consist of rifp and rifp | each of which ha distinct regulatori function | on role of rapp in length regul is to recruit these protein to the telomer |
