protein dna interact in solubl telosom from saccharomyc | telomer dna in saccharomyc is organ into non nucleosom chromatin structur the telosom that can be releas from chromosom end in solubl form by nucleas digest | wright | j | h | gottschl | d | e | and zakian | v | gene dev | the protein dna interact of solubl telosom by monitor telomer dna fragment for the retent of protein us both gel mobil shift and nitrocellulos filter bind assai | telosom protein associ with telomer dna at concentr of ethidium bromid that nucleosom | the protein dna interact in the yeast telosom also by much lower salt concentr than those known to disrupt either the interact of ciliat terminu bind protein with telomer dna or the interact of histon with dna in nucleosom | taken togeth | these data corrobor previous publish nucleas map data indic that telosom ar distinct in structur from convent nucleosom | these data also indic that yeast do not possess bind protein similar to those in ciliat that remain tightli to telomer dna even in high salt | in addit | the characterist gel mobil shift of solubl telosom could be mimick by complex in vitro with yeast telomer dna and recombin rapp suggest that rapp | known compon of solubl yeast telosom | wright | j | h | gottschl | d | e | and zakian | v | gene dev | conrad | m | n | wright | j | h | wolf | j | and zakian | v | cell | is like to be the major structur protein directli to yeast telomer dna |
