analysi of interact between ra and cdc guanin nucleotid exchang factor us yeast gal two hybrid system | our result demonstr that the gal two hybrid system can be us for studi interact of the wild type and mutant form of ra protein with the cdc guanin nucleotid exchang factor | cdc gef | in addit | our find show that neg result in the gal two hybrid system doe not indic that the two protein do not interact under all condit but onli that thei do not interact under the specif condit | we recommend that the two hybrid system be in combin with other approach | includ molecular genet analys and in vitro bind experi | for the studi of ra and cdc gef interact |
