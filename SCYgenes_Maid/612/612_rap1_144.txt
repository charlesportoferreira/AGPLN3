approach the function of new gene by detect of their potenti upstream activ sequenc in saccharomyc | applic to chromosom iii | the systematic sequenc of the yeast genom reveal the presenc of mani potenti gene of unknown function | on wai to approach their function is to defin which regulatori system control their transcript | thi can also be accomplish by the detect of an upstream activ sequenc | ua | such detect can be done by comput | that the definit of ua includ suffici and precis rule | we have such rule for the uass of the gal | rpg box | gcn | and the | regulatori protein | as well as for motif | pac | frequent upstream of the gene of the rna polymerase and subunit | these rule to the chromosom iii dna sequenc | and precis predict |
