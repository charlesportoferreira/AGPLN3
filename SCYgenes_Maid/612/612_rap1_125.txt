silenc of gene at nontelomer site in yeast is by sequestr of silenc factor at telomer by protein | rapp bind to silenc element and telomer repeat in yeast | where it appear to initi silenc by recruit sirp and sirp to the chromosom through interact with it carboxi termin domain | sirp and sirp interact in vitro with histon h and h and ar like to be structur compon of silent chromatin | we show that target of these sir protein to the chromosom is suffici to initi stabl silenc either at silent mate type lack function silenc element or at in strain in which the rapp carboxi termin silenc domain ha been | silenc by sir protein target can also be initi at proxim site | adh | but is much weaker at an intern chromosom | ly | strikingli | delet of the rapp silenc domain | which abolish telomer silenc | improv target silenc at ly by both sirp and sirp | while weaken the silenc activ of these protein at or near | thi effect mai result from the releas of sir protein from the telomer | thu increas their effect concentr at other chromosom site | we suggest that telomer and rapp serv regulatori role in sequest sir protein at telomer | control silenc at other loci in tran and prevent indiscrimin gene silenc throughout the genom |
