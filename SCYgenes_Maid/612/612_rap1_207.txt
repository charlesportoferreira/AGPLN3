protein activ and silenc transcript of mate type gene in yeast | is sequenc specif dna bind protein essenti for cell growth | the occurr of bind site in mani promot region | the mate type gene silenc element | and telomer suggest that ha multipl function in the cell | to assess it role in transcript | temperatur sensit in | analysi of rapt strain provid evid that function in both transcript activ and silenc of mate type gene | sever observ indic that rapt strain ar defect in the express of mat alpha | whose upstream activ sequenc | ua | contain bind site | at nonpermiss temperatur | decreas in mat alpha steadi state transcript level can be in mat alpha rapt strain | furthermor | these strain ar defici in alpha pheromon product and simultan express at least two alpha specif gene | these phenotyp can be revers by replac the bind site at mat alpha with bind site for the gal transcript activ | certain rapt allel have an opposit effect on the silent mate type hmr | which becom partial at nonpermiss temperatur |
