mutat analysi defin termin tail domain of essenti for telomer silenc in saccharomyc | allel specif defect in telomer silenc by in vitro mutagenesi of the yeast gene | the most sever phenotyp occur with three in the termin amino acid | two of the allel ar nonsens result in repressor | activ protein | speci lack the termin amino acid | the third allel is missens mutat within thi region | these allel defin novel amino acid region | the termin tail domain | that is essenti for telomer and hml silenc | us site mutagenesi | an amino acid region | amino acid | that is essenti for telomer silenc ha been within thi domain | further character of these allel ha that the termin tail domain also plai role in size control | the function of the termin tail in mainten is not mediat through the interact factor rif | allel defect in both the termin tail and rif interact domain have addit effect on length | overproduct of sir | dose depend enhanc of telomer silenc | suppress the telomer silenc | but not length | phenotyp of subset of termin tail allel | in contrast | an allel that truncat the termin amino acid of is refractori to sir overproduct | these result indic that the termin tail domain is for sir depend enhanc of telomer silenc | these data also suggest distinct of termin requir for size control and telomer silenc |
