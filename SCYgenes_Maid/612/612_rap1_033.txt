molecular basi for repeat diverg in bud yeast | telomeras is ribonucleoprotein that add repetit sequenc to the end of linear chromosom | therebi counteract nucleotid loss due to incomplet replic | short region of the telomeras rna subunit serv as templat for nucleotid addit onto the | end | although saccharomyc contain onli on telomeras rna gene | repeat sequenc ar degener in thi organ | base on detail analysi of the sequenc specifi by wild type and mutant rna templat in vivo | we show that the diverg of repeat is due to abort revers transcript in the | and | region of the templat and due to the align of telomer in multipl regist within the rna templat | through the interpret of wild type sequenc | we identifi nucleotid in the templat that ar not access for base pair dure substrat anneal | rather | these posit becom avail as templat for revers transcript onli after align with adjac nucleotid ha | indic that conform chang take place upon substrat bind | we also infer that the central part of the templat region is revers transcrib process | the inaccess of certain templat posit for align and the process polymerize of the central templat portion mai serv to reduc the possibl repeat diversif and enhanc the incorpor of bind site for rapp | the bind protein of bud yeast |
