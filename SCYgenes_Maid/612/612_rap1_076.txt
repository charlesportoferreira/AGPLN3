mutat of yeast ku gene the subnuclear organ of telomer | the mammalian ku and ku protein form heterodim that bind to the end of doubl strand dna in vitro and is for repair of radiat strand break and v | d | j recombin | delet of the saccharomyc gene hdf and hdf encod ykup and ykup | respect enhanc radiat sensit in background | in addit to repair defect | the length of the tg rich repeat on yeast end shorten dramat | we have shown previous that in yeast interphas nuclei | telomer ar cluster in limit number of foci near the nuclear peripheri | but the element that mediat thi local unknown | we report here that delet of the gene encod ykup or it partner ykup the posit of telomer dna in the yeast nucleu | these ar the first mutant shown to affect the subnuclear local of telomer | strain defici for either ykup or ykup telomer silenc | although thei repress at the silent mate type loci | in addit | the associ silenc factor sirp and sirp and the tg repeat bind protein rapp their punctat pattern of stain and dispers throughout the nucleoplasm | our result implic the yeast ku protein directli in aspect of organ | which in turn affect the repress of proxim gene |
