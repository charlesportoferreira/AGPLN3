genet probe of the yeast plasma membran h | atpas | the h | atpas from saccharomyc ha been probe by random genet approach that ha to the isol of primari and secondari site | these h | atpas | mutant help defin specif function | as well as interact | region of the h | atpas | cellular resist to hygromycin ha been an import select tool for the isol of pmal mutant | on promin hygromycin resist mutant | pmal | to have sf mutat near the site of phosphoryl | d | in the catalyt core | thi mutat prevent growth in low ph or nh | contain medium and induc an acid sensit vmax for atp hydrolysi | as well as insensit to vanad | the promin cellular and biochem phenotyp of thi strain detail revert analysi to identifi protein structur domain that interact directli or indirectli with the region by the f mutat | partial revert which resist to low ph or nh | but hygromycin resist | second site within the first and second cytoplasmic loop domain | as well as in transmembran segment amp | all of the revert enzyme have stabl vmax but some show chang in the ph optimum for atp hydrolysi | all displai vanad sensit rang between the insensit f mutant and the fulli sensit wild type | revert analys have also been on two other mutant which carri the av and gd in transmembran segment and | respect | compens second site to these in transmembran segment | amp | as well as within the central catalyt domain | these analys have help identifi interact protein structur domain that mai particip in coupl atp hydrolysi to proton transport | furthermor | thei facilit the construct of structur model to account for these interact |
