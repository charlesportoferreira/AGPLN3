biogenesi and function of the yeast plasma membran h | atpas | on of the most abund protein in the yeast plasma membran is the type h | atpas that pump proton out of the cell | suppli the drive forc for wide arrai of h | depend cotransport | the atpas is kda polypeptide | anchor in the bilayer by transmembran alpha helic | it is structur and function to the type na | k | h | k | and ca | atpas of anim cell and the h | atpas of plant cell | and it share with them characterist reaction mechan in which atp is split to adp and inorgan phosphat | i | via coval beta aspartyl phosphat intermedi | cryoelectron microscop imag of the h | atpas of neurospora and the sarcoplasm reticulum ca | atpas of anim cell have recent been at nm resolut | the membran embed portion of the molecul | which presum hous the cation transloc pathwai | is seen to be connect via narrow stalk to larg | multidomain cytoplasmic portion | known to contain the atp bind and phosphoryl site | in parallel with the structur studi | effort ar be to dissect structur | function relationship in sever type atpas by mean of site mutagenesi | thi paper review three phenotyp distinct class of mutant that have from work on the yeast h | atpas | mutant atpas that ar poorli fold and in the endoplasm reticulum | mutant in which the conform equilibrium ha been from the e | state | by high affin for vanad | to the e | state | by high affin for atp | and | mutant with coupl between atp hydrolysi and proton pump | although much remain to be learn befor the transport mechan can be fulli understood | these mutant serv to identifi critic part of the polypeptide that ar for protein fold | conform chang and h | atp coupl |
