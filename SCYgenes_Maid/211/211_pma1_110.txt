model conformation sensit region of the membran sector of the fungal plasma membran proton pump | molecular model for transmembran segment and from the fungal proton pump atpas ha been | and thi structur is to form helic hairpin loop structur in the membran | thi region becaus it is highli conformation activ and is to be an import site of action for clinic import therapeut in anim cell enzyme | the hairpin loop is to form an asymmetric tightli pack structur that is by an n cap between d and v | by hydrogen bond between residu in the turn region and the helic | and by pi pi interact between close appos aromat residu | short four shape turn is by hydrogen bond but is to be conformation heterogen | the princip effect of within the hairpin head region is to destabil the local close pack of side group which the pattern of hydrogen bond in and around the turn region | depend on the mutat | thi caus either or more global distort of the primari structur in the hairpin region | these structur mai explain the effect of in transmembran segment and on atp hydrolysi | sensit to vanad | and electrogen proton transport | the conform sensit of the hairpin structur around the turn mai also account for the effect of sch and possibl ouabain in block atpas function in anim cell enzyme | final | the model of transmembran segment and serv as templat to posit transmembran segment and | thi model provid new view of the h | atpas that promot novel structur | function experiment and could serv as the basi for more detail model of the membran sector of thi |
