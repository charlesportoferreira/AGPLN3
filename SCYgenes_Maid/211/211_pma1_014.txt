qualiti control in the yeast secretori pathwai | misfold h | atpas reveal two checkpoint | the yeast plasma membran h | atpas | by | is deliv to the cell surfac via the secretori pathwai and ha recent as an excel system for identifi qualiti control mechan along the pathwai | in the present studi | we have track the biogenesi of ga | misfold mutant form of the h | atpas | although thi mutant atpas is arrest transient in the peripher endoplasm reticulum | it doe not becom substrat for endoplasm reticulum associ degrad nor doe it appear to stimul an protein respons | instead | ga accumul in karp contain vesicular tubular cluster that resembl those previous in mammalian cell | like their mammalian counterpart | the yeast vesicular tubular cluster mai correspond to specif exit port from the endoplasm reticulum | sinc ga eventu escap from them | still in misfold | trypsin sensit form | to reach the plasma membran | by comparison with wild type atpas | ga spend short half life at the plasma membran befor be and sent to the vacuol for degrad in process that requir both endp and pepp | final | in separ of experi | ga to impos it phenotyp on co wild type atpas | transient retard the wild type protein in the er and later stimul it degrad in the vacuol | both effect serv to lower the steadi state amount of wild type atpas in the plasma membran and | thu | can explain the co domin genet behavior of the ga mutat | taken togeth | the result of thi studi establish ga as us new probe for the yeast secretori system |
