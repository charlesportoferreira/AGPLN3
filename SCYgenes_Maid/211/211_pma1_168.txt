in vivo glucos activ of the yeast plasma membran atpas | the addit of glucos to yeast cell activ proton efflux mediat by the plasma membran atpas | accordingli | the atpas activ of plasma membran is up to fold | the atpas ha more alkalin ph optimum | better affin for atp and greater sensit to vanad than the non | all these chang ar revers by wash the cell free of glucos | thi suggest two state of the atpas which ar interconvert by coval modif | as glucos doe not affect the phosphoryl of plasma membran polypeptide | other type of coval modif mai be |
