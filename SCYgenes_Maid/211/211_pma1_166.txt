the saccharomyc start mutant carri the cdc mutat is defect in activ of plasma membran atpas by glucos | activ of plasma membran atpas by the addit of glucos in sever cell divis cycle mutant of saccharomyc | the start mutant carri the cdc mutat shown to be defect in atpas activ at the restrict temperatur | genet analysi that lack of growth and defect activ of atpas at the restrict temperatur by the same mutat | it also that cdc doe not map at the same as the structur gene of plasma membran atpas | we conclud that the product of cdc control the activ of atpas |
