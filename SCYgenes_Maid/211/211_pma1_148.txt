delet analysi of yeast plasma membran h | atpas and identif of regulatori domain at the carboxyl terminu | the function of the amino and carboxyl termin domain of the yeast plasma membran h | atpas have been by construct delet in vitro and select express the mutant enzyme in vivo | the first amino acid ar dispens but delet of further amino acid greatli decreas the appear of the in the plasma membran | membran local is also by carboxyl termin delet which includ the last hydrophobic stretch | but the last amino acid of the atpas ar not | remov of the last amino acid produc an in glucos cell with the kinet paramet of the wild type atpas by glucos ferment | thi region seem to constitut regulatori domain |
