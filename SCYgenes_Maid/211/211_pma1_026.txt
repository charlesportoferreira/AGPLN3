the growth of mdp | rsp mutant of saccharomyc is by in the atp bind domain of the plasma membran h | atpas | in the gene | encod plasma membran h | atpas | that ar abl to the temperatur sensit | ts | phenotyp of mdp in rsp | the ubiquitin protein ligas gene | the mdp mutant previous to chang the mitochondri | cytosolic distribut of modp i | the trna modifi | and to affect fluid phase endocytosi | the data reveal that mdp mutant ar also ph sensit | and to hygromycin and paromomycin | the ts phenotyp | hygromycin and paromomycin sensit ar by pmal t | but the ph sensit | the effect of mdp on modp i cytoplasmic | mitochondri local and endocytosi ar not | character of pmal t the substitut of amino acid g | v in the atp bind domain of the h | atpas | our result indic that rsp ubiquitin protein ligas mai also influenc | in addit to protein distribut | the function of plasma membran h | atpas and the respons of cell to stress |
