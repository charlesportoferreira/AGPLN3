structur of plasma membran h | atpas gene from the plant arabidopsi thaliana | physiological and biochem studi have that the plant plasma membran h | atpas control mani import aspect of plant physiologi | includ growth | develop | nutrient transport | and stomata movement | we have start the genet analysi of thi by isol both genom and cdna clone of an h | atpas gene from arabidopsi thaliana | the gene is interrupt by intron | and there is partial conserv of exon boundari with respect to anim | na | k | and ca | atpas | in gener | the relationship between exon and the secondari and transmembran structur of differ atpas with intermedi support somewhat degener correspond between exon and structur modul | the amino acid sequenc of the plant h | atpas is more close to fungal and protozoan h | atpas than to bacteri k | atpas or to anim | na | k | h | k | and ca | atpas | there is evid for the exist of at least three isoform of the plant h | atpas gene | these result open the wai for molecular approach to the structur and function of the plant proton pump |
