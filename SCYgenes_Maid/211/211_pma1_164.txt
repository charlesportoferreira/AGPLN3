immunolog cross reactiv of fungal and yeast plasma membran h | atpas | the plasma membran h | atpas from fungi and yeast have similar catalyt and molecular properti | structur comparison ha been us immunoblot analysi with polyclonal antibodi toward the kda polypeptide of the plasma membran h | atpas from neurospora | strong cross reactiv is between the fungal h | atpas and the from the yeast saccharomyc and schizosaccharomyc | structur homolog ar also by the analysi of the cross reactiv peptid by proteolyt digest of neurospora and | enzyme | neither from these two sourc appear to be by highli sensit concanavalin affin assai on blot protein | glycoprotein of mr and pi | which comigr with cell cycle protein on d gel | is present in partial prepar of plasma membran h | atpas of | and it is shown to be structur unrel to h | atpas |
