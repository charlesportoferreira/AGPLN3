replac of the promot of the yeast plasma membran atpas gene by galactos depend promot and it physiological consequ | in order to probe the physiological role of the yeast plasma membran atpas we have the constitut promot of it gene by galactos depend promot | the result cell stop grow on glucos medium when the preform atpas is dilut to | of normal | there is correl between atpas activ and both proton efflux from the cell and amino acid transport | larg proport of growth arrest cell appear enlarg and with sever bud contain nuclei |
