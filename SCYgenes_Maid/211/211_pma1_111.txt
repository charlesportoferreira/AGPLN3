fungal plasma membran proton pump as promis new antifung target | fungi ar wide dispers in natur and frequent appear as pathogen in the anim and plant kingdom | the incid of opportunist fungal infect in human ha due to the human immunodefici viru and the applic of modern medic approach that subvert natur protect barrier to infect | also | fungal blight continu to threaten crop worldwid | as result | new antifung agent ar to address these critic problem | exist antifung can be to effect treat most case of topic infect by the opportunist pathogen candida albican | which is the princip agent of nosocomi fungal infect | howev | life threaten | dissemin candida infect ar treat with more modest success | exist antifung can be toxic or ineffect becaus of natur resist or even resist | thi limit efficaci larg reflect the restrict rang of cellular target consid dure the develop of current antifung | the advanc of highli select fungicid reagent requir the recognit of new essenti cellular target | the fungal plasma membran proton pump is high abund essenti with number of well understood molecular properti that should facilit the develop of new antifung | the proton pump is import for intracellular ph regul and the mainten of electrochem proton gradient for nutrient uptak | it is member of the type class of ion transport enzyme | which ar present in nearli all extern cellular membran | typical type enzyme such as the na | k | atpas and h | k | atpas ar well as specif target for surfac activ cardiac glycoside and anti ulcer therapeut | the develop of new class of select antifung target to the proton pump will requir exploit of the well genet | kinet | topolog | regulatori | and drug interact featur of the fungal that discrimin it from host type enzyme | new antifung drug of thi type should be relev to the control of fungal pathogen of medic and agricultur import and mai be applic to the control of intracellular parasit that also depend on close proton pump for surviv |
