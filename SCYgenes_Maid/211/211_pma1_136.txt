the plasma membran h | atpas from yeast | effect of ph | vanad and erythrosine on atp hydrolysi and atp bind | the h | atpas from the plasma membran of saccharomyc and | the rate of atp hydrolysi and atp bind as function of ph and the effect of the vanad and erythrosine inhibitor | the ph depend of the rate of atp hydrolysi form bell shape curv with maximum at ph and half maxim rate at ph | and | onli the ph depend between ph and ph | is revers | abov ph | and below ph | denatur of the is | the rate of atp bind show the same ph depend as that of atp hydrolysi | both ph depend can be by the dissoci of monoval acid group with pk of | it is that the must be proton befor atp bind | vanad doe not inhibit atp bind | adp releas or pi releas at concentr where complet inhibit of atp hydrolysi is | it is that vanad inhibit step of the reaction cycle which occur after pi releas | in contrast | erythrosine inhibit atp bind and thu affect the first step of the reaction cycle |
