the terminu of yeast plasma membran h | atpas is essenti for the regul of thi by heat shock protein hsp | but not for stress activ | sever stress caus addit activ to the glucos plasma membran h | atpas activ of yeast | but it is not clear how thi is achiev | we recent that cell lack the integr plasma membran heat shock protein hsp displai increas in plasma membran h | atpas activ with either heat shock or weak organ acid stress | piper | w | ortiz calderon | holyoak | coot | and cole | m | cell stress and chaperon | indic that the stress induct of hsp act to reduc stress stimul of the h | atpas | in thi studi it is shown that hsp act to reduc the vmax of h | atpas in heat shock cell | it action is with delet of the termin amino acid of the h | atpas | delet that doe not abolish the stress stimul of thi | mutat of the thr within the termin domain of h | atpas | potenti site of phosphoryl by the ca | calmodulin depend protein kinas | also abolish ani effect of hsp | hsp mai therefor be act on thr form of the h | atpas |
