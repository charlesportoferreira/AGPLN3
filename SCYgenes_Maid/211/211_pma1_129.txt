function express of plant plasma membran h | atpas in yeast endoplasm reticulum | recombin plant plasma membran h | atpas ha been in yeast express system compris multicopi and the strong promot of the yeast gene | western blot with specif monoclon antibodi that the plant atpas is on of the major membran protein by the cell | account for about | of total yeast protein | the plant atpas in yeast is fulli activ | it hydrolyze atp | pump proton | and the reaction cycle involv intermedi | phosphoryl is possibl from both atp and pi | unlik the situat in plant | howev | most of the plant atpas is not in the yeast plasma membran | rather | the appear to remain trap at veri earli stage of secretori pathwai | insert into the endoplasm reticulum | thi organel to prolifer in the form of stack membran surround the yeast nucleu in order to accommod the larg amount of plant atpas | in thi locat | the plant atpas can be with high yield | mg from kg of yeast | from membran devoid of endogen yeast plasma membran h | atpas | thi conveni express system could be us for other eukaryot membran protein and atpas |
