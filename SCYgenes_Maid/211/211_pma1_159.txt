membran potenti defect in hygromycin resist mutant of saccharomyc | the proton transport properti of hygromycin resist mutant which show kinet defect in the plasma membran h | atpas | it that net proton efflux | as by whole cell medium acidif in the presenc of mm kcl | similar for normal and mutant cell | howev | in the absenc of kcl | the extent of net proton efflux consider less in wild type than in mutant cell | the cellular membran potenti implic as an import factor in regul net proton transport and from | tetraphenylphosphonium uptak studi to be consider depolar in the mutant | the growth of wild type cell | which is normal by hygromycin at microgram | ml | to be resist to the antibiot by the addit of mm kcl to the growth medium | these result suggest that the electrogen behavior of proton transport by the h | atpas mai be in mutant and that resist to hygromycin mai be mediat via depolar of the cellular membran potenti |
