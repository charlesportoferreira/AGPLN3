near uv absorb chang and photochem decomposit of ergosterol in the plasma membran of the yeast saccharomyc | when cell of the yeast saccharomyc expos to near uv | nm | their absorpt spectra slightli within the rang nm with increas dosag | differ spectra | by substract the curv in cell expos to near uv from the curv of unexpos cell | with increas dosag over broad band with peak at | and nm and shoulder at nm | these peak in agreement with the absorpt maxima of ergosterol | which is on of the major compon of the plasma membran of yeast | near uv radiat simultan decreas in absorpt spectra and reduct of ergosterol content in the plasma membran | photochem decomposit of ergosterol by near uv radiat in vivo | although ergosterol is gener known to be photoconvert to previtamin d industri by uv radiat in vitro | in order to remov photosensit | liposom from phospholipid and glycolipid | with or without ergosterol from yeast plasma membran | liposom ergosterol in the orient state photochem decompos by near uv radiat but ergosterol in the disorient state in homogen solut not | near uv radiat also decreas in activ of membran atpas | dose respons curv for the reduct of atpas activ similar to that for decomposit of ergosterol | suggest that near uv membran function damag |
