 | fed data suggest no change in monetary policy | by kathleen hays | reuters | new york | june new u | s | banking data suggest the | federal reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path | and is not signalling any imminent change of course | economists | said | but they also said that if money supply growth remains | weak | as this week | s unexpected eight billion dlr m decline | suggests it may | this could influence the fed to loosen its | credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary | policy | a reuter survey of money market economists produced a | forecast of a mln dlr m decline for the week ended june | with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a | decline of four billion | instead | m fell eight billion dlrs | to | billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate | coming on the heels of a | billion decrease in m for | the week ended june | this means the nation | s money supply has | fallen more than billion dlrs in the past two weeks | economists said | m has hit an air pocket of weakness | said bill sullivan | of dean witter reynolds inc | while m may have lost its significance as an indicator of | economic growth | sullivan said fed officials might be concerned | the latest drop in m means another month of sluggish growth | in the broader monetary aggregates | m and m | which are seen | as better gauges of economic growth | latest monthly m and m data showed that as of may | both | measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the fed | s | to | pct target ranges | if money growth does not accelerate | fed officials | concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging | could turn toward easier monetary policy | economists said | does this mean that the fed abandons its current open | market position | no | sullivan said | but does this mean the end | of tightening for the time being | definitely yes | economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings | of mln dlrs for the latest two week bank statement period | were lower than they had expected | most believed the fed had | targetted a two week borrowings average of around mln dlrs | but they said that if it had not been for a large one day | net miss in the fed | s reserve projections | the higher | borrowings target would probably have been reached | a drop in may u | s | housing starts and continued weakness in | auto sales show key sectors of the u | s | economy are lagging | while a recent modest | pct gain in may producer prices has | helped dispel inflation fears | slifer said | if this continues | we can entertain the notion of fed | easing at some point | he said | other economists said the fed would probably pay little | attention to weak money supply growth | it has been a number of | years since m has given good signs of what | s going on in the | economy | one said | i don | t think m shows that the economy is | falling apart and the fed should ease | economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a | prerequisite for any move by the fed toward easier monetary | policy | they said the fed is reluctant to lower short term rates | for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and | higher inflation which would push up long term yields and choke | off econmomic growth | but sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late | april | the fed has to determine if this represents a | fundamental change for the dollar | if it does | then this gives | them more room to ease | he said |
