 | energy | u | s | petrochemical industry | by julie vorman | reuters | houston | april cheap oil feedstocks | the weakened u | s | dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching pct will | propel the streamlined u | s | petrochemical industry to record | profits this year | with growth expected through at least | major company executives predicted | this bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an | industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted gaf | corp | privately held cain chemical inc | and other firms | to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants | oil companies such as ashland oil inc | the | kentucky based oil refiner and marketer | are also shopping for | money making petrochemical businesses to buy | i see us poised at the threshold of a golden period | said | paul oreffice | chairman of giant dow chemical co | adding | there | s no major plant capacity being added around the world | now | the whole game is bringing out new products and improving | the old ones | analysts say the chemical industry | s biggest customers | automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of | paints and plastics | are expected to buy quantities this year | u | s | petrochemical plants are currently operating at about | pct capacity | reflecting tighter supply that could hike | product prices by to pct this year | said john dosher | managing director of pace consultants inc of houston | demand | for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up | by as much as pct | he said | oreffice | speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in | houston | said dow would easily top the mln dlrs it earned | last year and predicted it would have the best year in its | history | in | when oil prices were still above dlrs a barrel | and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong u | s | dollar | dow had profits of mln dlrs | i believe the entire | chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it | oreffice said | gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the u | s | chemical | industry would report a pct gain in profits during | last year | the domestic industry earned a total of billion | dlrs | a pct leap from | the turn in the fortunes of the once sickly chemical | industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and | planning | said pace | s john dosher | dosher said last year | s fall in oil prices made feedstocks | dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar | was weakening against foreign currencies | that helped boost | u | s | chemical exports | also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has | been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical | manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers | in the early s | finally | virtually all major u | s | chemical manufacturers | have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program | to mothball inefficient plants | trim the payroll and eliminate | unrelated businesses | the restructuring touched off a flurry of | friendly and hostile takeover attempts | gaf | which made an unsuccessful attempt in to acquire | union carbide corp | recently offered three billion dlrs | for borg warner corp | a chicago manufacturer of plastics | and chemicals | another industry powerhouse | w | r | grace | has divested its retailing | restaurant and fertilizer | businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions | but some experts worry that the chemical industry may be | headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on | the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities | such as | ethylene | in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that | are custom designed for a small group of buyers | companies like dupont and monsanto co spent the | past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity | chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had | deteriorated | dosher said | but i think they will eventually | kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche | market | some top chemical executives share the concern | the challenge for our industry is to keep from getting | carried away and repeating past mistakes | gaf | s heyman | cautioned | the shift from commodity chemicals may be | ill advised | specialty businesses do not stay special long | houston based cain chemical | created this month by the | sterling investment banking group | believes it can generate | mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend | chairman gordon cain | who previously led a leveraged buyout | of dupont | s conoco inc | s chemical business | has spent | billion dlrs since january to buy seven petrochemical plants | along the texas gulf coast | the plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that | are the building blocks of specialty products | this kind of commodity chemical business will never be a | glamorous | high margin business | cain said | adding that demand | is expected to grow by about three pct annually | garo armen | an analyst with dean witter reynolds | said | chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for | plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum | wood | and steel products | armen estimated the upturn in the chemical | business could last as long as four or five years | provided the | u | s | economy continues its modest rate of growth |
